  "description": "This policy identifies AWS S3 bucket having a policy that does not enforce only HTTPS requests. Enforcing the S3 bucket to accept only HTTPS requests would prevent potential attackers from eavesdropping on data in-transit or manipulating network traffic using man-in-the-middle or similar attacks. It is highly recommended to explicitly deny access to HTTP requests in S3 bucket policy.",
