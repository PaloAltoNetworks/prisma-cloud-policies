  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Cloud Run service revisions that are utilizing the default service account with the editor role. \n\nGCP Compute Engine Default service account is automatically created upon enabling the Compute Engine API. This service account is granted the IAM basic Editor role by default, unless explicitly disabled. Assigning default service account with the editor role to cloud run revisions could lead to privilege escalation. Granting minimal access rights helps in promoting a better security posture.\n\nFollowing the principle of least privileges, it is recommended to avoid assigning default service account with the editor role to cloud run revision.",
