  "description": "This policy identifies the Azure accounts in which activity log alert for Create or update public IP address rule does not exist.\n\nCreating an activity log alert for create or update public IP address rule gives insight into network rule access changes and may reduce the time it takes to detect suspicious activity. By enabling this monitoring, you get alerts whenever any changes are made to public IP address rules.\n\nAs a best practice, it is recommended to have a activity log alert for create or update public IP address rule to enhance network security monitoring and detect suspicious activities.",
