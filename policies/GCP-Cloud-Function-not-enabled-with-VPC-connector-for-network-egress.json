  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Cloud Functions that are not enabled with a VPC connector for network egress. This includes both Cloud Functions v1 and Cloud Functions v2.\n\nUsing a VPC connector for network egress in GCP Cloud Functions is crucial to prevent security risks such as data interception and unauthorized access. This practice strengthens security by allowing safe communication with private resources, enhancing traffic monitoring, reducing the risk of data leaks, and ensuring compliance with security policies.\n\nNote: For a Cloud Function to access public traffic using Serverless VPC Connector, Cloud NAT might be needed.\nLink: https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/networking/network-settings#route-egress-to-vpc\n\nIt is recommended to configure GCP Cloud Functions with a VPC connector.",
