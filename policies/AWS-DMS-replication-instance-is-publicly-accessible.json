  "description": "This policy identifies AWS DMS (Database Migration Service) replication instances with public accessibility enabled.\n\nA DMS replication instance is used to connect and read the source data and prepare it for consumption by the target data store. When AWS DMS replication instances are publicly accessible, it increases the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and potentially malicious activities.\n\nIt is recommended to disable the public accessibility of DMS replication instances to decrease the attack surface.",
