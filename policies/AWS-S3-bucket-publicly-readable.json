  "description": "This policy identifies the S3 buckets that are publicly readable by Get/Read/List bucket operations. These permissions permit anyone, malicious or not, to Get/Read/List bucket operations on your S3 bucket if they can guess the namespace. S3 service does not protect the namespace if ACLs and Bucket policy is not handled properly, with this configuration you may be at risk of compromise of critical data by leaving S3 public.\n\nFor more details:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/set-permissions.html\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/about-object-ownership.html#ensure-object-ownership ",

If Access Control List is set to 'Public' follow the below steps\na. Under 'Access Control List', Click on 'Everyone' and uncheck all items\nb. Under ''Access Control List'', Click on ''Authenticated users group'' and uncheck all items\nc. Click on Save changes\n6. If 'Bucket Policy' is set to public follow the below steps\na. Under 'Bucket Policy', Select 'Edit Bucket Policy' and consider defining what explicit 'Principal' should have the ability to GET/LIST objects in your S3 bucket. You may also want to specifically limit the 'Principal' ability to perform specific GET/LIST functions, without the wild card.\nIf 'Bucket Policy' is not required delete the existing 'Bucket Policy'.\nb. Click on Save changes\n\nNote: Make sure updating 'Access Control List' or 'Bucket Policy' does not affect S3 bucket data access.",
