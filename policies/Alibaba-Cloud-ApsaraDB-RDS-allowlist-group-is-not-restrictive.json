  "description": "This policy identifies ApsaraDB for Relational Database Service (RDS) allowlist groups which are not restrictive. The value 0.0.0.0/0 indicates that all devices can access the RDS instance and The value 127.0.0.1 is the default IP address means that no devices can access the RDS instance. As a best practice, It is recommended that you periodically check and adjust your allowlists to maintain RDS security.",
