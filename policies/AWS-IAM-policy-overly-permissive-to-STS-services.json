  "description": "This policy identifies the IAM policies that are overly permissive to STS services. AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) is a web service that enables you to request temporary credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate (federated users). It is recommended to follow the principle of least privileges ensuring that only restricted STS services for restricted resources.",
