  "description": "This policy identifies Batch Accounts configured with overly permissive network access. By default, Batch accounts are accessible from all the networks. With an Account access IP firewall, you can restrict it further to only a set of IPv4 addresses or IPv4 address ranges. With Private access Virtual Networks, the network traffic path is secured on both ends. It is recommended to configure the Batch account with an IP firewall or by Virtual Network, so that the Batch account is accessible only to restricted entities.",
