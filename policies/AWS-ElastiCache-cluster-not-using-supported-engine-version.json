  "description": "This policy identifies AWS Elastic Redis or Memcache cluster not using the supported engine version.\n\nAWS ElastiCache simplifies deploying, operating, and scaling Redis and Memcached in-memory caches in the cloud. An ElastiCache cluster not using a supported engine version runs on outdated Redis or Memcached versions. These versions may be end-of-life (EOL) or lack current updates and patches from AWS. This exposes the cluster to unpatched vulnerabilities, compliance risks, and potential service instability.\n\nIt is recommended to regularly update your ElastiCache clusters to the latest supported engine versions as recommended by AWS.",
