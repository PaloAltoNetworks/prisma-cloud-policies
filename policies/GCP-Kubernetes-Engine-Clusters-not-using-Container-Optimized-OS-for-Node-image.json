  "description": "This policy identifies Kubernetes Engine Clusters which do not have a container-optimized operating system for node image. Container-Optimized OS is an operating system image for your Compute Engine VMs that is optimized for running Docker containers. By using Container-Optimized OS for node image, you can bring up your Docker containers on Google Cloud Platform quickly, efficiently, and securely. The Container-Optimized OS node image is based on a recent version of the Linux kernel and is optimized to enhance node security. It is also regularly updated with features, security fixes, and patches. The Container-Optimized OS image provides better support, security, and stability than other images.",
