  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Container Registries with exports enabled.\n\nAzure Container Registries with exports enabled allows data in the registry to be moved out using commands like acr import or acr transfer. Export functionality can expose registry data, increasing the risk of unauthorized data movement. Disabling exports ensures that data in a registry is accessed only via the dataplane (e.g., docker pull) and cannot be moved out using other methods.\n\nAs a security best practice, it is recommended to disable export configuration for Azure Container Registries.",
