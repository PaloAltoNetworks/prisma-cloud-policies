  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Cloud Functions that are not configured with a VPC connector. VPC connector helps function to connect to a resource inside a VPC in the same project. Setting up the VPC connector allows you to set up a secure perimeter to guard against data exfiltration and prevent functions from accidentally sending any data to unwanted destinations. It is recommended to configure the GCP Cloud Function with a VPC connector.\n\nNote: For the Cloud Functions function to access the public traffic with Serverless VPC connector, you have to introduce Cloud NAT.\nLink: https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/networking/network-settings#route-egress-to-vpc",
