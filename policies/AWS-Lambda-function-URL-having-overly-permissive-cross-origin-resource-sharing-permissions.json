  "description": "This policy identifies AWS Lambda functions which have overly permissive cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) permissions. Overly permissive CORS settings (allowing wildcards) can potentially expose the Lambda function to unwarranted requests and cross-site scripting attacks. It is highly recommended to specify the exact domains (in 'allowOrigins') and HTTP methods (in 'allowMethods') that should be allowed to interact with your function to ensure a secure setup.",
