  "description": "This policy identifies AWS CloudTrails in which log validation is not enabled in all regions. CloudTrail log file validation creates a digitally signed digest file containing a hash of each log that CloudTrail writes to S3. These digest files can be used to determine whether a log file was modified after CloudTrail delivered the log. It is recommended that file validation be enabled on all CloudTrails.",
