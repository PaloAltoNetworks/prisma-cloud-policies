  "description": "This policy identifies AWS IAM Principals with service account privileges.\n\nAssigning a principal the Service account role in Google Cloud allows them to impersonate service accounts and use their permissions. This means the principal can perform actions on behalf of the service account, essentially inheriting all permissions granted to that service account.\n\nTo maintain the security of your information and resources, it is crucial to assign this role only to authorized and trusted IAM Principals.",
