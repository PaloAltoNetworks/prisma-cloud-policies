  "name": "Azure Network Security Group having Inbound rule overly permissive to all traffic on TCP protocol",
  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) which are overly permissive to all traffic on TCP protocol. A network security group contains a list of security rules that allow or deny inbound or outbound network traffic based on source or destination IP address, port, and protocol. As a best practice, it is recommended to configure NSGs to restrict traffic from known sources, allowing only authorized protocols and ports.",

Select 'All services'.\n3. Select 'Network security groups', under NETWORKING.\n4. Select the Network security group you need to modify.\n5. Select 'Inbound security rules' under Settings.\n6.
