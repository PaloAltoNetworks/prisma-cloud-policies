  "description": "This policy identifies Memorystore for Redis instances not encrypted with CMEK.\n\nGCP Memorystore for Redis is a fully managed in-memory data store that simplifies Redis deployment and scaling while ensuring high availability and low-latency access. By using CMEK with Redis instance, you retain complete control over the encryption keys protecting your sensitive data, ensuring that only authorized users with access to these keys can decrypt and access the information. Without CMEK, data is encrypted with Google-managed keys, which may not provide the level of control required for handling sensitive data in certain industries.\n\nIt is recommended to encrypt Redis instance data using a Customer-Managed Encryption Key (CMEK).",
