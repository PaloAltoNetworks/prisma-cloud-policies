  "description": "This policy identifies the AWS Secrets Manager secret not rotated successfully based on the rotation schedule.\n\nSecrets Manager stores secrets centrally, encrypts them automatically, controls access, and rotates secrets safely. By rotating secrets, you replace long-term secrets with short-term ones, limiting the risk of unauthorized use. If secrets fail to rotate in Secrets Manager, long-term secrets remain in use, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.\n\nIt is recommended that proper configuration and monitoring of the rotation process be ensured to mitigate these risks.",
