  "description": "This policy identifies GCP SQL Instances that are not encrypted with Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK).\n\nUsing CMEK for SQL Instances provides greater control over data at rest encryption by allowing key rotation and revocation, which enhances security and helps meet compliance requirements. Encrypting SQL Instances with CMEK ensures better data privacy management.\n\nIt is recommended to use CMEK for SQL Instance encryption.",
