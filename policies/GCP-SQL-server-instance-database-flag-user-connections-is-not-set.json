  "description": "This policy identifies GCP SQL server instances where the database flag 'user connections' is not set. The user connections option specifies the maximum number of simultaneous user connections (value varies in range 10-32,767) that are allowed on an instance of SQL Server. The default is 0, which means that the maximum (32,767) user connections are allowed. It is recommended to set database flag user connections for SQL Server instance according to organization-defined value.",
