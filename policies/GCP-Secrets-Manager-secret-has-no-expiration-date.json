  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Secret Manager secrets that have no expiration date.\n\nGCP Secret Manager securely stores and controls access to API keys, passwords, certificates, and other sensitive data. Without an expiration date, secrets remain vulnerable indefinitely. Setting an expiration date limits the potential damage of a security breach, as compromised credentials will eventually become invalid.\n\nIt is recommended to configure secrets with an expiration date to reduce the risk of long-lived secrets being compromised or abused.",
