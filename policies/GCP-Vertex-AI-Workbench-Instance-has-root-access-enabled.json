  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Vertex AI Workbench Instances that have root access enabled.\n\nEnabling root access on a GCP Vertex AI Workbench instance increases the risk of unauthorized system changes, privilege escalation, and data exposure. It can also make the instance more vulnerable to attacks if not properly secured. Limiting root access and applying strict access controls are essential to reduce these risks.\n\nIt is recommended to disable root access for GCP Vertex AI Workbench Instances.",
