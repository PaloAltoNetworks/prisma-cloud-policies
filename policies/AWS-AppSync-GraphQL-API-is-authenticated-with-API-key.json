  "name": "AWS AppSync GraphQL API is authenticated with API key",
  "description": "This policy identifies the AWS AppSync Graphql API using API key for primary or additional authentication methods.\n\nAWS AppSync GraphQL API is a fully managed service by Amazon Web Services for building scalable and secure GraphQL APIs. An API key is a hard-coded value in your application generated by the AWS AppSync service when you create an unauthenticated GraphQL endpoint. Using API keys for authentication can pose security risks such as exposure to unauthorized access and limited control over access privileges, potentially compromising sensitive data and system integrity.\n\nIt is recommended to use authentication methods other than API Keys like IAM, Amazon Cognito User Pools, or OpenID Connect providers for securing AWS AppSync GraphQL APIs, to ensure enhanced security and access control.",
