  "description": "This policy identifies the AWS regions that do not have a log metric filter and alarm for usage of a root account. Monitoring for root account logins will provide visibility into the use of a fully privileged account and an opportunity to reduce its use it. Failure to monitor root account logins may result in a lack of visibility into unauthorized use or attempts to access the root account, posing potential security risks to your AWS environment. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for detecting changes to CloudTrail's configurations.\n\nNOTE: This policy will trigger alert if you have at least one Cloudtrail with the multi trial is enabled, Logs all management events in your account and is not set with specific log metric filter and alarm.",
