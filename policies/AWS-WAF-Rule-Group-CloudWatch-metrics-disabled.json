  "description": "This policy identifies the AWS WAF Rule Group having CloudWatch metrics disabled.\n\nAWS WAF rule groups have CloudWatch metrics that provide information about the number of allowed and blocked web requests, counted requests, and requests that pass through without matching any rule in the rule group. These metrics can be used to monitor and analyse the performance of the web access control list (web ACL) and its associated rules.\n\nIt is recommended to enable CloudWatch metrics for a WAF rule group to help in monitoring and analysis of web requests.",
