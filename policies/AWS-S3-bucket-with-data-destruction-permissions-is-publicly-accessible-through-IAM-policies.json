  "description": "Having a publicly accessible AWS S3 bucket with the 's3:DeleteBucket' and 's3:DeleteObject' permissions can be extremely risky. This combination of permissions allows anyone with access to the bucket to delete both the bucket itself and any objects within it. If unauthorized access or compromise occurs, it could result in intentional or accidental data destruction, leading to permanent loss of important or sensitive information stored in the bucket.",
