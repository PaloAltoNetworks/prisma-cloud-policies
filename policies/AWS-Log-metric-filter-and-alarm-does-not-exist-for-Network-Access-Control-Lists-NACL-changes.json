  "description": "This policy identifies the AWS regions which do not have a log metric filter and alarm for Network Access Control Lists (NACL) changes. Monitoring changes to NACLs will help ensure that AWS resources and services are not unintentionally exposed. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for changes made to NACLs.\n\nNOTE: This policy will trigger alert if you have at least one Cloudtrail with the multi trial is enabled, Logs all management events in your account and is not set with specific log metric filter and alarm.",
