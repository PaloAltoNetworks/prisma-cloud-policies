  "name": "Azure storage account infrastructure encryption is disabled",
  "description": "The policy identifies Azure storage accounts for which infrastructure encryption is disabled.\n\nInfrastructure double encryption adds a second layer of encryption using service-managed keys. When infrastructure encryption is enabled for a storage account or an encryption scope, data is encrypted twice. Once at the service level and once at the infrastructure level - with two different encryption algorithms and two different keys. Infrastructure encryption is recommended for scenarios where double encrypted data is necessary for compliance requirements.\n\nIt is recommended to enable infrastructure encryption on Azure storage accounts so that encryption can be implemented at the layer closest to the storage device or network wires.",

  "recommendation": "Configuring Infrastructure double encryption for Azure Storage accounts is only allowed during storage account creation. Once the storage account is provisioned, you cannot change the storage encryption.\n\nTo create an Azure Storage account with Infrastructure double encryption, follow the below URL:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/infrastructure-encryption-enable\n\nNOTE: Using Infrastructure double encryption will have performance impact on the read and write speeds of Azure storage accounts due to the additional encryption process.",
