It supports managing traffic flows between services, enforcing access policies, and aggregating telemetry data, all without requiring changes to the microservice code.\n\nThis policy checks your cluster for the Istio add-on feature and alerts if it is not enabled.",

As when creating a new cluster, we suggest at least a 4 node cluster with the 2 vCPU machine type.\n\nYour cluster must also be running a supported cluster master version to use the add-on.\n\n1. Go to the Kubernetes clusters page in the GCP Console and select the cluster you want to update.\n2. Select Edit.\n3. Select Add-ons to display possible add-ons, including Istio on GKE.\n4. Select Enabled under Istio.\n5. Select the mTLS security mode you want to use for your cluster from the drop-down.\n6. Click Save to update your cluster.",
