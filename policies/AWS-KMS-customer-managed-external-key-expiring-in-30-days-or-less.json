  "name": "AWS KMS customer managed external key expiring in 30 days or less",
  "description": "This policy identifies KMS customer managed external keys which are expiring in 30 days or less. As a best practice, it is recommended to reimport the same key material and specifying a new expiration date. If the key material expires, AWS KMS deletes the key material and the customer managed external key becomes unusable.",

  "searchModel.query": "config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name = 'aws-kms-get-key-rotation-status' AND json.rule = 'keyMetadata.origin contains EXTERNAL and keyMetadata.keyManager contains CUSTOMER and keyMetadata.enabled is true and (_DateTime.ageInDays($.keyMetadata.validTo) > -30)'",
  "recommendation": "1. Sign into the AWS console\n2. In the console, select the specific region from region drop down on the top right corner, for which the alert is generated\n3. Navigate to Key Management Service (KMS) Dashboard\n4. Click on Customer managed keys (Left Panel)\n5. Click on reported KMS Customer managed key\n6. Under 'Key material' section, Delete the existing key material before you reimport the key material by clicking on 'Delete key material'\n7. Click on 'Upload key material'\n8. Under 'Encrypted key material and import token' section, Reimport same encrypted key material and import token\n9. Under 'Expiration option', Select 'Key material expires' and choose new expiration date in 'Key material expires at' date box\n10. Click on 'Upload key material' button\nNOTE: Deleting key material makes all data encrypted under the customer master key (CMK) unrecoverable unless you later import the same key material into the CMK. The CMK is not affected by this operation.",
