  "description": "This policy identifies AWS SNS Topics that are not encrypted by Customer Managed Key (CMK).\n\nAWS SNS Topics are used to send notifications to subscribers and might contain sensitive information. SNS Topics are encrypted by default by a AWS managed key but users can specify CMK to get enhanced security, control over the encryption key and also comply with any regulatory requirements.\n\nAs a security best practice use of CMK to encrypt your SNS Topics is advisable as it gives you full control over the encrypted data.",
