  "description": "This policy identifies the DMS replication tasks that are logging isn't enabled or the minimum severity level is less than LOGGER_SEVERITY_DEFAULT for TARGET_APPLY and TARGET_LOAD.\n\nAmazon DMS Logging is crucial in DMS replication for monitoring, troubleshooting, auditing, performance analysis, error detection, recovery, and historical reporting. TARGET_APPLY and TARGET_LOAD must be logged because they manage to apply data and DDL changes, as well as loading data into the target database, crucial for maintaining data integrity during migration. The absence of logging for TARGET_APPLY and TARGET_LOAD components hampers monitoring, compliance, auditing, troubleshooting, and accountability efforts during migration.\n\nIt's recommended to enable logging for AWS DMS replication tasks and set a minimal logging level of DEFAULT for TARGET_APPLY and TARGET_LOAD to ensure that informational messages, warnings, and error messages are written to the logs.",
