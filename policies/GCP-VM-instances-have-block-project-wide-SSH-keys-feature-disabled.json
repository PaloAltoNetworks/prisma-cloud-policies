  "description": "This policy identifies VM instances which have block project-wide SSH keys feature disabled. Project-wide SSH keys are stored in Compute/Project-metadata. Project-wide SSH keys can be used to login into all the instances within a project. Using project-wide SSH keys eases the SSH key management but if compromised, poses the security risk which can impact all the instances within a project. It is recommended to use Instance specific SSH keys which can limit the attack surface if the SSH keys are compromised.",
