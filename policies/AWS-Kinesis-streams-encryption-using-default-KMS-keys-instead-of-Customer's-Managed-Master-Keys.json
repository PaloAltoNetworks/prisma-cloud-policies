  "description":"This policy identifies the AWS Kinesis streams which are encrypted with default KMS keys and not with Master Keys managed by Customer. It is a best practice to use customer managed Master Keys to encrypt your Amazon Kinesis streams data. It gives you full control over the encrypted data.",
