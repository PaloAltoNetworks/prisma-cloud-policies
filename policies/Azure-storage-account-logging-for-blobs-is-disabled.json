  "description":"Storage Logging records details of requests (read, write, and delete operations) against your Azure blobs. The logs include additional information such as:\n- Timing and server latency.\n- Success or failure, and HTTP status code.\n- Authentication details\n\nThis policy identifies Azure storage accounts that do not have logging enabled for blobs. As a best practice, enable logging for read, write, and delete request types on blobs.",
