  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks with JupyterLab interface access mode set to single user.\n\nVertex AI Workbench user-managed notebook can be accessed using the web-based JupyterLab interface. Access mode controls the control access to this interface. Allowing access to only a single user could limit collaboration, increase chances of credential sharing, and hinder security audits and reviews of the resource.\n\nIt is recommended to avoid single user access and make use of the service account access mode for user-managed notebooks.",
