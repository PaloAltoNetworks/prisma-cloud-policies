  "description": "This policy identifies the AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) that is disabled.\n\nEnsuring that your Amazon Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key is enabled is important because it determines whether the key can be used to perform cryptographic operations.  If an AWS KMS Key is disabled, any operations dependent on that key, such as encryption or decryption of data, will fail. This can lead to application downtime, data access issues, and potential data loss if not addressed promptly.\n\nIt is recommended to enable the AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) if it is used in the application, to restore cryptographic operations and ensure your applications and services can access encrypted data.",
