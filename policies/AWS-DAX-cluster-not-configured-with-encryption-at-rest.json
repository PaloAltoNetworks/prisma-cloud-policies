  "description": "This policy identifies the AWS DAX cluster where encryption at rest is disabled.\n\nAWS DAX cluster encryption at rest provides an additional layer of data protection, helping secure your data from unauthorized access to underlying storage. Without encryption, anyone with access to the storage media could potentially intercept and view the data.\n\nIt is recommended to enable encryption at rest for the AWS DAX cluster.",
