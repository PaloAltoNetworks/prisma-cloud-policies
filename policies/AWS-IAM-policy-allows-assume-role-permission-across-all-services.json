  "description": "This policy identifies AWS IAM policy which allows assume role permission across all services. Typically, AssumeRole is used if you have multiple accounts and need to access resources from each account then you can create long term credentials in one account and then use temporary security credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming roles in those accounts.",
