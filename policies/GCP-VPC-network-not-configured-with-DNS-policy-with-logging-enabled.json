  "description": "This policy identifies the GCP VPC networks which are not configured with DNS policy with logging enabled. Monitoring of Cloud DNS logs provides visibility to DNS names requested by the clients within the VPC. These logs can be monitored for anomalous domain names and evaluated against threat intelligence. It is recommended to enable DNS logging for all the VPC networks.\nNote: For full capture of DNS, firewall must block egress UDP/53 (DNS) and TCP/443 (DNSover HTTPS) to prevent client from using external DNS name server for resolution.",
