  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Logic apps that are configured with public network access.\n\nExposing Logic Apps directly to the public internet increases the attack surface, making them more susceptible to unauthorized access, security threats, and potential breaches. By limiting Logic Apps to private network access, they are securely managed and less prone to external vulnerabilities.\n\nAs a security best practice, it is recommended to configure private network access or restrict the public exposure only to the required entities instead of wide ranges.",
