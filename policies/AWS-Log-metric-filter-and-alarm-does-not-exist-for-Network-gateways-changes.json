  "description": "This policy identifies the AWS regions which do not have a log metric filter and alarm for Network gateways changes. Monitoring changes to network gateways will help ensure that all ingress/egress traffic traverses the VPC border via a controlled path. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for changes to network gateways.\n\nNOTE: This policy will trigger alert if you have at least one Cloudtrail with the multi trial is enabled, Logs all management events in your account and is not set with specific log metric filter and alarm.",
