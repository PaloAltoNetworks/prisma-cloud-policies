  "description": "This policy identifies GCP API keys that are not restricting any specific APIs. API keys are insecure because they can be viewed publicly, such as from within a browser, or they can be accessed on a device where the key resides. It is recommended to restrict API keys to use (call) only APIs required by an application.",
