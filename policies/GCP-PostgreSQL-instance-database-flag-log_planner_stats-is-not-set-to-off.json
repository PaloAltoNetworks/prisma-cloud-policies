  "description": "This policy identifies PostgreSQL database instances in which database flag log_planner_stats is not set to off. The PostgreSQL planner/optimizer is responsible to create an optimal execution plan for each query. The log_planner_stats flag controls the inclusion of PostgreSQL planner performance statistics in the PostgreSQL logs for each query. This can be useful for troubleshooting but may increase the number of logs significantly and have performance overhead. It is recommended to set log_planner_stats off.",
