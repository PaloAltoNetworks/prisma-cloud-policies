If this instance is not authorized to process or host Java Spring Framework related services then terminate the services and change the ACL to block the outgoing traffic.\n5. If this instance is authorized to use Java Spring Framework related services then upgrade Java Spring Framework to the latest version to fix this vulnerability.",
