  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Logic apps that are not utilizing HTTP 2.0 version.\n\nAzure Logic app using HTTP 1.0 for its connection is considered not secure as HTTP 2.0 version has additional performance improvements on the head-of-line blocking problem of old HTTP version, header compression, and prioritisation of requests. HTTP 2.0 no longer supports HTTP 1.1's chunked transfer encoding mechanism, as it provides its own, more efficient, mechanisms for data streaming.\n\nAs a security best practice,  it is recommended to configure HTTP 2.0 version for Logic apps connections.",
