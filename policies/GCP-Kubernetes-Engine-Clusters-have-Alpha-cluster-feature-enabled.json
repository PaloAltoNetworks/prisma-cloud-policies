So to resolve this alert, create a new cluster with the alpha feature disabled, then migrate all required cluster data from the reported cluster to this newly created cluster and delete reported Kubernetes engine cluster.\n\nTo create new Kubernetes engine cluster with the alpha feature disabled, perform the following: \n1. Login to GCP Portal\n2. Go to Kubernetes Engine (Left Panel)\n3. Select Kubernetes clusters \n4. Click on CREATE CLUSTER button\n5. Set new cluster parameters as per your requirement and make sure 'Enable Kubernetes alpha features in this cluster' is unchecked.\n6.
