  "name": "Azure Network Security Group allows all traffic on ICMP (Ping)",
  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Network Security Groups (NSG) that allow all traffic on ICMP (Ping) protocol. ICMP is used by devices to communicate error messages and status. While ICMP is useful for  diagnostics and troubleshooting, it can also be used to exploit or disrupt systems. Review your list of NSG rules to ensure that your resources are not exposed. As a best practice, restrict ICMP (Ping) solely to known static IP addresses. Limit the access list to include known hosts, services, or specific employees only.",
