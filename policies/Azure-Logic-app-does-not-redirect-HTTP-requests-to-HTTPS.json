  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Logic apps that fail to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.\n\nBy default, Azure Logic app data is accessible through unsecured HTTP traffic. HTTP does not include any encryption and data sent over HTTP is susceptible to interception and eavesdropping. To secure web traffic, use HTTPS which incorporates encryption through SSL/TLS protocols, providing a secure channel over which data can be transmitted safely.\n\nAs a security best practice,  it is recommended to configure HTTP to HTTPS redirection to prevent unauthorized parties from being able to read or modify the data in transit.",
