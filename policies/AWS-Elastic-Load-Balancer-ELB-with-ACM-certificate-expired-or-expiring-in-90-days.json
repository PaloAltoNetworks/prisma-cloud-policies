  "name": "AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) with ACM certificate expired or expiring in 90 days",
  "description": "This policy identifies Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) which are using ACM certificates expired or expiring in 90 days. AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is the preferred tool to provision, manage, and deploy your server certificates. With ACM you can request a certificate or deploy an existing ACM or external certificate to AWS resources. As a best practice, it is recommended to reimport expiring/expired certificates while preserving the ELB associations of the original certificate.",
