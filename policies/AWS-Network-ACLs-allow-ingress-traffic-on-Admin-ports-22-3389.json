  "description": "This policy identifies the AWS Network Access Control List (NACL) which has a rule to allow ingress traffic to server administration ports.\n\nAWS NACL provides filtering of ingress and egress network traffic to AWS resources. Allowing ingress traffic on admin ports 22 (SSH) and 3389 (RDP) via AWS Network ACLs increases the vulnerability of EC2 instances and other network resources to unauthorized access and cyberattacks.\n\nIt is recommended that no NACL allows unrestricted ingress access to server administration ports, such as SSH port 22 and RDP port 3389.\n\nNOTE: This policy may report NACLs, which include the deny policy in the rule set. Make sure while remediating the rule set does not consist of the Allow and Deny rule set together; which leads to overlap on each ruleset.",
