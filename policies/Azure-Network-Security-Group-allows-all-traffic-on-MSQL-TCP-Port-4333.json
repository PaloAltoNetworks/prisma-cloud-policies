  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Network Security Groups (NSG) that allow all traffic on MSQL (TCP Port 4333). Review your list of NSG rules to ensure that your resources are not exposed. As a best practice, restrict MSQL solely to known static IP addresses. Limit the access list to include known hosts, services, or specific employees only.",
