  "description": "This policy identifies RDS DB(Relational Database Service Database) clusters which are encrypted using default KMS key instead of CMK (Customer Master Key). As a security best practice CMK should be used instead of default KMS key for encryption to gain the ability to rotate the key according to your own policies, delete the key, and control access to the key via KMS policies and IAM policies.",

  "recommendation": "RDS DB clusters can be encrypted only while creating the database cluster. You can't convert an unencrypted DB cluster to an encrypted one. However, you can restore an unencrypted Aurora DB cluster snapshot to an encrypted Aurora DB cluster. To do this, specify a KMS encryption key when you restore from the unencrypted DB cluster snapshot.\n\nStep 1: To create a 'Snapshot' of the unencrypted DB cluster,\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_CreateSnapshotCluster.html\nNOTE: As you can't restore from a DB cluster snapshot to an existing DB cluster; a new DB cluster is created when you restore. Once the Snapshot status is 'Available'.\n\nStep 2: Follow the below link to restoring the Cluster from a DB Cluster Snapshot,\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.html\n\nOnce the DB cluster is restored and verified, follow below steps to delete the reported DB cluster,\n1. Log in to the AWS Management Console\n2. In the console, select the specific region from region drop down on the top right corner, for which the alert is generated.\n3. Navigate to 'RDS' dashboard from 'Services' dropdown\n4. In the navigation pane, choose ‘Databases’\n5. In the list of DB instances, choose a writer instance for the DB cluster\n6. Choose 'Actions', and then choose 'Delete'\nFMI:\n1. While deleting a RDS DB cluster, customer has to disable 'Enable deletion protection' otherwise instance cannot be deleted\n2. While deleting RDS DB instance , AWS application will ask the end user to take Final snapshot\n3. If a RDS DB cluster has a writer role instance, then User has to delete the write instance to delete the main cluster (Delete option won’t be enabled for main RDS DB cluster)",
