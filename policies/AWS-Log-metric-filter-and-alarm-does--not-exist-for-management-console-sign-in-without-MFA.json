  "description": "This policy identifies the AWS regions that do not have a log metric filter and alarm for management console sign-in without MFA.\n\nA log metric filter in AWS CloudWatch scans log data for specific patterns and generates metrics based on those patterns. Unauthorized access attempts may go undetected without a log metric filter and alarm for console sign-ins without MFA. This increases the risk of account compromise and potential data breaches due to inadequate security monitoring.\n\nIt is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for management console sign-in without MFA to increase visibility into accounts that are not protected by MFA.\n\nNOTE: This policy will trigger an alert if you have at least one Cloudtrail with the multi-trail is enabled, Logs all management events in your account, and is not set with a specific log metric filter and alarm.",
