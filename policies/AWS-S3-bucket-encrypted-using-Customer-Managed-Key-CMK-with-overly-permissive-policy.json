  "description": "This policy identifies Amazon S3 buckets that use Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) for encryption that have a key policy overly permissive. Amazon S3 bucket encryption key overly permissive can result in the exposure of sensitive data and potential compliance violations. As a security best practice, It is recommended to follow the principle of least privilege ensuring that the KMS key policy does not have all the permissions to be able to complete a malicious action.",

Click on the 'Key policy' tab on the navigated KMS key window.\n6. Click on 'Edit'.\n7. Replace the 'Everyone' grantee (i.e. '*') from the Principal element value with an AWS account ID or an AWS account ARN.\n OR \nAdd a Condition clause to the existing policy statement so that the KMS key is restricted.\n8.
