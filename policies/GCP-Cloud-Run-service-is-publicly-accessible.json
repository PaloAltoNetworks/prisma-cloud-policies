  "description": "Publicly accessible GCP Cloud Run services pose a significant security risk, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data and potential service disruptions.\n\nCloud Run services are configured to allow invocation via HTTP requests. Granting the 'Cloud Run Invoker' permission to 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' exposes the service to the public internet. Attackers could exploit this misconfiguration to gain unauthorized access, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or malicious code execution.\n\nThe impact ofthis misconfiguration includes data breaches, unauthorized resource access, and potential service compromise. Restricting access to only authorized users and services ensures that only legitimate requests can interact with the Cloud Run service, mitigating these risks. Least privilege access control is crucial for enhanced security.\n\nTo remediate this, restrict access to the Cloud Run service. Grant the 'Cloud Run Invoker' role only to specific service accounts or users as needed, and avoid granting it to 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' unless explicitly required for a publicly accessible API. Regularly review and update permissions to maintain a strong security posture.",
