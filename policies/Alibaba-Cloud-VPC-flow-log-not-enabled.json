  "description": "This policy identifies Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) where flow logs are not enabled.\n\nVPC flow logs capture information about the traffic entering and exiting network interfaces in the VPC. Without VPC flow logs, thereâ€™s limited visibility into network traffic, making it challenging to detect and investigate suspicious activities, potential data breaches, or security policy violations. Enabling VPC flow logs enhances network monitoring, improves threat detection, and supports compliance requirements.\n\nAs a security best practice, it is recommended to enable VPC flow logs.",
