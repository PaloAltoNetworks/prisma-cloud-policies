  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Cloud Functions that are granted a basic role. This includes both Cloud Functions v1 and Cloud Functions v2.\n\nBasic roles are highly permissive roles that existed before the introduction of IAM and grant wide access over project to the grantee. The use of basic roles for granting permissions increases the blast radius and could help to escalate privilege further in case the Cloud Function is compromised.\n\nFollowing the principle of least privilege, it is recommended to avoid the use of basic roles.",
