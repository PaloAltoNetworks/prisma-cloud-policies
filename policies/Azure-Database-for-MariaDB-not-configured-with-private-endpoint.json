  "description": "This policy identifies Azure MariaDB database servers that are not configured with private endpoint. Private endpoint connections enforce secure communication by enabling private connectivity to Azure Database for MariaDB. Configuring a private endpoint enables access to traffic coming from only known networks and prevents access from malicious or unknown IP addresses which includes IP addresses within Azure. It is recommended to create private endpoint for secure communication for your Azure MariaDB database.",
