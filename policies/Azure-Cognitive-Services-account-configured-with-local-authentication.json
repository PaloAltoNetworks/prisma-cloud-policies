  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Cognitive Services accounts that are configured with local authentication methods instead of AD identities. Local authentication allows users to access the service using a local account and password, rather than an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account. Disabling local authentication methods improves security by ensuring that Cognitive Services accounts require Active Directory identities exclusively for authentication. It is recommended to disable local authentication methods on your Cognitive Services account, instead use Azure Active Directory identities.",
