  "description": "This policy identifies Azure PostgreSQL (PaaS) instances that are internet reachable from untrusted internet source on TCP port 5432. PostgreSQL (PaaS) instances with untrusted access to the internet may enable bad actors to use brute force on a system to gain unauthorised access to the entire network. As a best practice, restrict traffic from untrusted IP addresses and limit the access to known hosts, services, or specific entities.",

  "recommendation": "The following steps are recommended to restrict unrestricted access from the Internet:\n1. Visit the Network path Analysis from Source to Destination and review the network path components that allow internet access.\n2. Identify the network component on which restrictive rules can be implemented.\n3. Implement the required changes and make sure no other resources have been impacted due to these changes:\n\ta) Move the instance inside a restrictive subnet if the instance does not need to be publicly accessible.\n\tb) If reported IP address intended to access from internet, Add that IP address to Trusted IP Addresses.\n\tc) If reported IP address unintended to access from internet, Remove the public IP assigned to the respective instance.",
