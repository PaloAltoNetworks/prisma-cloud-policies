  "description": "This policy identifies the AWS regions which do not have a log metric filter and alarm for AWS Config configuration changes. Monitoring changes to AWS Config configuration will help ensure sustained visibility of configuration items within the AWS account. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for detecting changes to AWS Config's configurations.\n\nNOTE: This policy will trigger alert if you have at least one Cloudtrail with the multi trial is enabled, Logs all management events in your account and is not set with specific log metric filter and alarm.",
