  "description": "This policy identifies GCP IAM users assigned with primitive roles. Primitive roles are Roles that existed prior to Cloud IAM. Primitive roles (owner, editor) are built-in and provide a broader access to resources making them prone to attacks and privilege escalation. Predefined roles provide more granular controls than primitive roles and therefore Predefined roles should be used.\n\nNote: For a new GCP project, service accounts are assigned with role/editor permissions. GCP recommends not to revoke the permissions on the SA account. Reference: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts\n\nLimitation: This policy alerts for Service agents which are Google-managed service accounts. Service Agents are by default assigned with some roles by Google cloud and these roles shouldn't be revoked.\nReference: https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-agents\nIn case any specific service agent needs to be bypassed, this policy can be cloned and modified accordingly",
