  "name": "GCP VM instance has risky basic role assigned",
  "description": "GCP VM instances with overly permissive 'basic' roles assigned present a significant security risk. These roles grant extensive project-wide access, increasing the impact of a compromise.\n\nThe 'basic' roles, legacy permissions predating granular IAM controls, offer broad access. A compromised Virtual Machine with a 'basic' role could enable attackers to escalate privileges across the entire project, leading to data breaches, unauthorized resource modification, or complete account takeover.\n\nExploiting this misconfiguration could result in a severe data breach, service disruption, or full project compromise. Using the principle of least privilege, assigning only necessary permissions, significantly reduces the attack surface and limits potential damage from a compromised Virtual Machine.\n\nTo remediate this, replace 'basic' roles with fine-grained IAM roles granting only the required permissions for each Virtual Machine. Regularly review assigned roles, removing unnecessary access to maintain a strong security posture. Employ automated monitoring and alerting for unexpected role assignments.",
