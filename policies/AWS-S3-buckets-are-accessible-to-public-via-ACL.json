  "description": "This policy identifies S3 buckets which are publicly accessible via ACL. Amazon S3 often used to store highly sensitive enterprise data and allowing public access to such S3 bucket through ACL would result in sensitive data being compromised. It is highly recommended to disable ACL configuration for all S3 buckets and use resource based policies to allow access to S3 buckets.",
