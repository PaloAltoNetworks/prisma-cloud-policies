  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Vertex AI Endpoints that are not encrypted with CMEK.\n\nCustomer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) for a Vertex AI Endpoint provide control over the encryption of data at rest. Encrypting GCP Vertex AI Endpoints with CMEK enhances security by giving you full control over encryption keys. This ensures data protection, especially for sensitive models and predictions. CMEK allows key rotation and revocation, aligning with compliance requirements and offering better data privacy management.\n\nIt is recommended to use CMEK for Vertex AI Endpoint encryption.",
