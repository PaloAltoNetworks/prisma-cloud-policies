As a security best practice enabled CMK should be used instead of the default KMS key for encryption to gain the ability to rotate the key according to your own policies, delete the key, and control access to the key via KMS policies and IAM policies.\n\nFor details:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/at-rest-encryption.html#using-customer-managed-keys-for-elasticache-security",
