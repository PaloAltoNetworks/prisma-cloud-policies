  "name": "Memcached default UDP port is publicly accessible",
  "description": "This policy identifies Memcached which has a default UDP port publicly accessible. Memcached is a general-purpose distributed memory caching system. It is often used to speed up dynamic database-driven websites by caching data and objects in RAM to reduce the number of times an external data source (such as a database or API) must be read. Memcached having UDP port 11211 public accessible is often vulnerable to DDoS amplification attack. This policy aims at finding such a Memcached which has an UDP port open to the public. It is highly recommended disabling Memcached UDP port.",
