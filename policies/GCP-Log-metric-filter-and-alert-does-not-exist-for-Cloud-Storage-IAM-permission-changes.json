  "description": "This policy identifies the GCP account which does not have a log metric filter and alert for Cloud Storage IAM permission changes. Monitoring Cloud Storage IAM permission activities will help in reducing time to detect and correct permissions on sensitive Cloud Storage bucket and objects inside the bucket. It is recommended to create a metric filter and alarm to detect activities related to the Cloud Storage IAM permission.",
