  "description": "This policy identifies the AWS EC2 instance having a public IP address assigned.\n\nAWS EC2 instances with public IPs are virtual servers hosted in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud that can be accessed over the internet. Public IPs increase an EC2 instance's attack surface, necessitating robust security configurations to prevent unauthorized access and attacks.\n\nIt is recommended to use private IPv4 addresses for communication between EC2 instances and disassociate the public IP address from an instance or disable auto-assign public IP addresses in the subnet.",
