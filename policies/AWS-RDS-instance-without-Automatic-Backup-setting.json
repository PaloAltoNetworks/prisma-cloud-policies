  "name": "AWS RDS instance without Automatic Backup setting",
  "description": "This policy identifies RDS instances which are not set with the Automatic Backup setting. If Automatic Backup is set, RDS creates a storage volume snapshot of your DB instance, backing up the entire DB instance and not just individual databases which provide for point-in-time recovery. The automatic backup will happen during the specified backup window time and keeps the backups for a limited period of time as defined in the retention period. It is recommended to set Automatic backups for your critical RDS servers that will help in the data restoration process.",
