  "description": "This policy identifies GCP OS Images that are publicly accessible.\n\nCustom GCP OS images are user-created operating system images tailored to specific needs and configurations. Making these images public can expose sensitive data, proprietary software, and security vulnerabilities. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and system exploitation, compromising your infrastructure's security and integrity.\n\nIt is recommended to keep OS images private unless required for organizational needs.",
