  "description": "Checks to verify if any VM instance is initiated with the flag 'Pre-Emptible termination' set to True. Setting this instance to True implies that this VM instance will shut down within 24 hours or can also be terminated by a Service Engine when high demand is encountered. While this might save costs, it can also lead to unexpected loss of service when the VM instance is terminated.",

  "recommendation": "Once a VM instance is started with Pre-Emptible set to Yes, it cannot be changed. If this instance with Pre-Emptible set is a critical resource, then spin up a new VM instance with necessary services, processes, and updates so that there will be no interruption of services.",
