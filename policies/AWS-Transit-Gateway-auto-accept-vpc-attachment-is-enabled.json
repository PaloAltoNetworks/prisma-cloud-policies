  "description": "This policy identifies if Transit Gateways are automatically accepting shared VPC attachments. When this feature is enabled, the Transit Gateway automatically accepts any VPC attachment requests from other AWS accounts without requiring explicit authorization or verification. This can be a security risk, as it may allow unauthorized VPC attachments to connect to the Transit Gateway. As per the best practices for authorization and authentication, it is recommended to turn off the AutoAcceptSharedAttachments feature.",
