  "description": "This policy identifies GCP VM instances that have Shielded VM Secure Boot disabled.\n\nSecure Boot is a security feature that ensures only trusted, digitally signed software runs during the boot process of a computer. Enabling it helps protect against malware and unauthorized software by verifying the integrity of the bootloader and operating system. Without Secure Boot, systems are vulnerable to rootkits, bootkits, and other malicious code that can compromise the system from the start, making it difficult to detect and remove such threats.\n\nIt is recommended to enable Shielded VM secure boot for GCP VM instances.",
