  "description": "This policy identifies PostgreSQL database instances in which database flag log_statement_stats is not set to off. The log_statement_stats flag enables a crude profiling method for logging end-to-end performance statistics of a SQL query. This can be useful for troubleshooting but may increase the number of logs significantly and have performance overhead. It is recommended to set log_statement_stats as off.\n\nNote:  The flag 'log_statement_stats' cannot be enabled with other\nmodule statistics (log_parser_stats, log_planner_stats, log_executor_stats).",
