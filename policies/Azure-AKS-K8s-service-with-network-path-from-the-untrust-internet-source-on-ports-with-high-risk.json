  "description": "This policy identifies Azure AKS Kubernetes services with network paths from untrusted internet sources on ports with high risk.\n\nAzure AKS Kubernetes services exposed to untrusted internet sources on ports with high-risk ports increase the risk of unauthorized access, cyber-attacks, and data breaches, as they may provide a larger attack surface for malicious actors. These container services are particularly vulnerable to brute-force attacks and exploits targeting known vulnerabilities.\n\nAs a best practice, it is recommended to allow access from the Trusted IP list and limit  access from known hosts, services, or specific entities.\n\nNOTE: Prisma Cloudâ€™s Trusted IP List feature allows administrators to specify a list of IP addresses that are considered trusted or safe.",
