  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud where the Agentless container vulnerability assessment is set to Off.\n\nAgentless container vulnerability assessment enables automatic scanning for vulnerabilities in container images stored in Azure Container Registry or running in Azure Kubernetes Service without additional agents. Disabling it exposes container images to unpatched security issues and misconfigurations, risking exploitation and data breaches. Enabling agentless container vulnerability assessment ensures continuous scanning for known vulnerabilities, enhancing security by proactively identifying risks and providing remediation suggestions to maintain compliance with industry standards.\n\nAs a security best practice, it is recommended to enable Agentless container vulnerability assessment in Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud.",
