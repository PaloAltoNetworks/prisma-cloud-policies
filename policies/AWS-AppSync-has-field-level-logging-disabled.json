  "description": "This policy identifies an AWS AppSync GraphQL API not configured with field-level logging with either 'ERROR' or 'ALL'.\n\nAWS AppSync is a managed GraphQL service that simplifies the development of scalable APIs. Field-level logging in AWS AppSync lets you capture detailed logs for specific fields in your GraphQL API. Without enabling field-level logging, the security monitoring and debugging capabilities may be compromised, increasing the risk of undetected threats and vulnerabilities.\n\nIt is recommended to enable field-level logging to ensure granular visibility into API requests, aiding in security, and compliance with regulatory requirements.",
