  "description": "This policy identifies EKS cluster Security groups that are overly permissive to all traffic. Doing so, may allow a bad actor to brute force their way into the system and potentially get access to the entire network. Review your list of security group rules to ensure that your resources are not exposed. As a best practice, restrict traffic solely from known static IP addresses. Limit the access list to include known hosts, services, or specific employees only.",
