  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Machine Learning workspaces that are not enforced with Managed Virtual Network Isolation.\n\nManaged Virtual Network Isolation ensures that the workspace and its resources are accessible only within a secure virtual network. Without enforcing this isolation, the environment becomes vulnerable to security risks like external threats, data leaks, and non-compliance. If not properly isolated, the workspace may be exposed to public networks, increasing the chances of unauthorized access and data breaches.\n\nAs a security best practice, it is recommended to configure Azure Machine Learning workspaces with Managed Virtual Network Isolation. This will restrict network access to the workspace and ensure that it can only be accessed from authorized networks.",
