  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Database for MySQL flexible servers which have firewall rule allowing access to all IPV4 address.\n\nMySQL server having a firewall rule with start IP being 0.0.0.0 and end IP being 255.255.255.255 (i.e. all IPv4 addresses) would allow access to server from any host on the internet. Allowing access to all IPv4 addresses expands the potential attack surface and exposes the MySQL server to increased threats.\n\nAs a best security practice, it is recommended to configure the MySQL servers with restricted IP-based server-level firewall rules so that servers are accessible only to restricted entities.",
