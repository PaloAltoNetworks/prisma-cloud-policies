Redshift clusters exposed to the internet are prone to external security threats. It is highly recommended to restrict network interfaces that are attached to the Redshift cluster to known hosts or services only.",

Visit the Network path Analysis from Source to Destination and review the network path components that allow internet access.\n2. Identify the network component on which restrictive rules can be implemented.\n3. Implement the required changes and make sure no other resources have been impacted due to these changes:\n a) The overly permissive Security Group rules can be made more restrictive.\n b) Move the Redshift cluster inside a restrictive subnet if the cluster does not need to be publicly accessible.\n c) Define a NAT rule to restrict traffic coming from the Internet to the respective Redshift cluster.",
