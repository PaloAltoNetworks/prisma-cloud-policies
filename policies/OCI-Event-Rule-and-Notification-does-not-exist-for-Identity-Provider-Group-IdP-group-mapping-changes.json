  "description": "This policy identifies the OCI compartments which do not have an Event Rule and Notification that gets triggered for Identity Provider Group Mappings (IdP) changes. Monitoring and alerting on changes to IdP group mapping will help in identifying changes to the security posture. It is recommended that an Event Rule and Notification be configured to catch changes made to Identity Provider Group Mappings (IdP).\nNOTE: \n1. Event Rules are compartment scoped and will detect events in child compartments, it is recommended to create the Event rule at the root compartment level.\n2. This policy will trigger alert if you have at least one Event Rule and Notification, even if OCI has single or multi compartments.",
