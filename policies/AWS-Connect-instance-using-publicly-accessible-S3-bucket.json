  "recommendation": "To update the publicly accessible setting of a bucket, perform the following actions:\n1. Log in to the AWS Console\n2. Navigate to the 'S3' service\n3. Click on the S3 resource reported in the alert\n4. Click on the 'Permissions' tab\n5. If Access Control List is set to 'Public' follow the below steps\n         a. Under 'Access Control List', Click on 'Everyone' and uncheck all items\n         b. Under 'Access Control List', Click on 'Authenticated users group' and uncheck all items\n         c. Click on Save changes\n6. If 'Bucket Policy' is set to public follow the below steps\n         a. Under 'Bucket Policy', Select 'Edit Bucket Policy' and consider defining what explicit 'Principal' should have the ability to GET/LIST objects in your S3 bucket. You may also want to limit the 'Principal' ability to perform specific GET/LIST functions, without the  wild card.\n         b. If 'Bucket Policy' is not required delete the existing 'Bucket Policy'.\n         c. Click on Save changes\nNote: Ensure updating the 'Access Control List' or 'Bucket Policy' does not affect S3 bucket data access.",
