Database events are tracked by the Auditing feature and the events are written to an audit log in your Audit log destinations. This process helps you to monitor database activity, and get insight into anomalies that could indicate business concerns or suspected security violations.",

It is recommended that you enable only server-level auditing and leave the database-level auditing disabled for all databases.\n\nTo enable auditing at server level:\n1. Log in to the Azure Portal\n2. Note down the reported SQL database and SQL server\n3. Select 'SQL servers', Click on the SQL server instance you wanted to modify\n4. Select 'Auditing' under 'Security' section, and set the status to 'On' and choose any Audit log destinations.\n5.  Click on 'Save'\n\nIt is recommended to avoid enabling both server auditing and database blob auditing together, unless:\nIf you want to use a different storage account, retention period or Log Analytics Workspace for a specific database or want to use for audit event types or categories for a specific database that differ from the rest of the databases on the server.\nTo enable auditing at database level:\n1.
