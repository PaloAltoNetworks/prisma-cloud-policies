  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks that have Integrity monitoring disabled.\n\nIntegrity Monitoring continuously monitors the boot integrity, kernel integrity, and persistent data integrity of the underlying VM of the shielded user-managed notebooks. It detects unauthorized modifications or tampering, enhancing security by verifying the trusted state of VM components throughout their lifecycle. It provides active alerting allowing administrators to respond to integrity failures and prevent compromised nodes from being deployed into the cluster.\n\nIt is recommended to enable integrity monitoring for user-managed notebooks to detect and mitigate advanced threats like rootkits and bootkit malware.",
