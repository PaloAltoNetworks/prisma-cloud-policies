  "description": "This policy identifies the AWS Bedrock agent that is not associated with Bedrock guardrails\n\nAmazon Bedrock Guardrails provides governance and compliance controls for generative AI applications, ensuring safe and responsible model use. Associating Guardrails with the Bedrock agent is useful for implementing governance and compliance controls in generative AI applications. Not linking Guardrails to the Bedrock agent raises the risk of non-compliance and harmful AI application outputs.\n\nIt is recommended that AWS Bedrock agents be associated with Bedrock guardrails to implement safeguards and prevent unwanted behavior from model responses or user messages.",
