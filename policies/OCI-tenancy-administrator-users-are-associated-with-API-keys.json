  "description": "This policy identifies OCI users who are the members of Administrators group, has API keys associated. It is recommended not to allow OCI users with API keys to have direct tenancy access, to preserve privileged security principle. As a best practice, dissociate the API keys for the OCI Users of Administrators group and use Service-level administrative users with API keys instead.",
