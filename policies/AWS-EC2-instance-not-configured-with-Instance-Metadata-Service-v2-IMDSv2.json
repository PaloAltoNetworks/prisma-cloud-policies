  "description": "This policy identifies AWS instances that are not configured with Instance Metadata Service v2 (IMDSv2). With IMDSv2, every request is now protected by session authentication. IMDSv2 protects against misconfigured-open website application firewalls, misconfigured-open reverse proxies, unpatched SSRF vulnerabilities, and misconfigured-open layer-3 firewalls and network address translation. It is recommended to use only IMDSv2 for all your EC2 instances.\n\nFor more details:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html",
