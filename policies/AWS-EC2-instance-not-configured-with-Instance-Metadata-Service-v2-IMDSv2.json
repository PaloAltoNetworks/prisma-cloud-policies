  "name": "AWS EC2 instance not configured with Instance Metadata Service v2 (IMDSv2)",
  "description": "AWS EC2 instances lacking Instance Metadata Service v2 (IMDSv2) are susceptible to unauthorized access of sensitive metadata. Using IMDSv1 exposes instances to various attacks through easily exploitable misconfigurations.\n\nThe Instance Metadata Service provides metadata about the EC2 instance, including security credentials. IMDSv1 uses a simple HTTP request, making it vulnerable to attacks such as session hijacking and credential theft. Failure to use IMDSv2 exposes the instance to compromise via techniques like SSRF, potentially leading to further lateral movement within the environment.\n\nCompromise of instance metadata can result in unauthorized access to the instance and sensitive data it holds, leading to data breaches, service disruptions, and potential financial losses. IMDSv2 mitigates these risks with its session-based authentication mechanism.\n\nEnable IMDSv2 for all EC2 instances. Restrict access to instance metadata by using strong authentication mechanisms and regularly review and update instance configurations. Consider implementing additional security controls such as network segmentation and intrusion detection systems to further enhance security posture.",
