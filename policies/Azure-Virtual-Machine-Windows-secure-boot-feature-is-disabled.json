  "description": "This policy identifies Virtual Machines (Windows) that have secure boot feature disabled. Enabling Secure Boot on supported Windows virtual machines provides mitigation against malicious and unauthorised changes to the boot chain. Secure boot helps protect your VMs against boot kits, rootkits, and kernel-level malware. So it is recommended to enable Secure boot for Azure Windows virtual machines. \n\nNOTE: This assessment only applies to trusted launch enabled Windows virtual machines. You can't enable trusted launch on existing virtual machines that were initially created without it. \nTo know more, refer https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/trusted-launch?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Security",
