  "description": "This policy identifies GCP API key not restricted to use by specified Hosts and Apps. Unrestricted keys are insecure because they can be viewed publicly, such as from within a browser, or they can be accessed on a device where the key resides. It is recommended to restrict API key usage to trusted hosts, HTTP referrers and apps.",
