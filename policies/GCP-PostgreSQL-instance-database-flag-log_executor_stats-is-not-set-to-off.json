  "description": "This policy identifies PostgreSQL database instances in which database flag log_executor_stats is not set to off. The log_executor_stats flag enables a crude profiling method for logging PostgreSQL executor performance statistics. Even though it can be useful for troubleshooting, it may increase the number of logs significantly and have performance overhead. It is recommended to set log_executor_stats off.",
