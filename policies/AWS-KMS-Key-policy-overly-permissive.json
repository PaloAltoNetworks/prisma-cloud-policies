  "description": "This policy identifies KMS Keys that have a key policy overly permissive. Key policies are the primary way to control access to customer master keys (CMKs) in AWS KMS. It is recommended to follow the principle of least privilege ensuring that KMS key policy does not have all the permissions to be able to complete a malicious action.\n\nFor more details:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/control-access-overview.html#overview-policy-elements",
