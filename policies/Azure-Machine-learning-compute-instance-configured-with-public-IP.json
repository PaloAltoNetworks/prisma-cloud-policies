  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Machine Learning compute instances which are configured with public IP.\n\nConfiguring an Azure Machine Learning compute instance with a public IP exposes it to significant security risks, including unauthorized access and cyber-attacks. This setup increases the likelihood of data breaches, where sensitive information and intellectual property could be accessed by unauthorized individuals, leading to potential data leakage and loss.\n\nAs a best practice, it is recommended not to configure Azure Machine Learning instances with public IP.",

  "recommendation": "Note: Disabling a public IP address on an existing Azure Machine Learning compute instance is not supported without deleting and recreating the instance. To secure your instance, itâ€™s recommended to configure it without a public IP from the start. Additionally, to update an existing Azure Machine Learning workspace to use a managed virtual network, all compute resources (including compute instances, compute clusters, and managed online endpoints) must first be deleted.\n\nTo create a new compute instance with no public IP:\n1. Log in to Azure Portal and search for 'Azure Machine Learning'\n2. Select 'Azure Machine Learning'\n3. Select the Azure Machine Learning Workspace that the reported compute instance is associated with\n4. Under 'Settings' go to 'Networking' section\n5. At the top, select the 'Workspace managed outbound access' tab\n6. Select either 'Allow Internet Outbound' or 'Allow Only Approved Outbound' based on your requirements, if one hasn't been chosen already\n7. Click on 'Save'\n8. On the 'Overview' page, click the 'Studio web URL' link to log in to Azure ML Studio\n9. A new tab will open for Azure ML Studio\n10. In the left panel, under 'Manage' section, click on the 'Compute'\n11. Click 'New' to create a new compute instance\n12. In the 'Security' tab, under the 'Virtual network' section, enable the 'No public IP' option to disable the public IP\n13. Select 'Review + Create' to create the compute instance",
