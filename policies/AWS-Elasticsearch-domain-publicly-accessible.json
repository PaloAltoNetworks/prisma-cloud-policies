  "description": "This policy identifies Elasticsearch domains which are publicly accessible. Enabling VPCs for Elasticsearch domains provides flexibility and control over the clusters access with an extra layer of security than Elasticsearch domains that use public endpoints. It also keeps all traffic between your VPC and Elasticsearch domains within the AWS network instead of going over the public Internet.",

So to resolve this alert, create a new domain with VPC, then migrate all required Elasticsearch domain data from the reported Elasticsearch domain to this newly created domain and delete reported Elasticsearch domain.\n\nTo set up the new ES domain with VPC, refer the following URL:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-createupdatedomains.html\nTo create Elasticsearch domain within VPC, In Network configuration choose VPC access instead of Public access.\n\nTo delete reported ES domain, refer the following URL:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-gsg-deleting.html",
