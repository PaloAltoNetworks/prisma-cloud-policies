  "description": "This policy identifies Elasticsearch domains which are publicly accessible. Enabling VPCs for Elasticsearch domains provides flexibility and control over the clusters access with an extra layer of security than Elasticsearch domains that use public endpoints. It also keeps all traffic between your VPC and Elasticsearch domains within the AWS network instead of going over the public Internet.",
