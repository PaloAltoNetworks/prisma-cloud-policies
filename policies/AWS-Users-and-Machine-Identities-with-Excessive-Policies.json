  "description": "This policy identifies AWS IAM policies that contain '*' in the Action or/and Resource section. IAM policies control user and machine permissions in AWS. Using '*' in the Action or Resource section can grant the ability to perform a wide variety of actions on a wide variety of resources. This means an identity with such a policy could perform a range of actions on many resources, depending on the exact policy, potentially bypassing intended security restrictions. This increases the attack surface and potential damage faced should an attacker gain access to such an identity.",
