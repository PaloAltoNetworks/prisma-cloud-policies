  "description": "This policy identifies AWS IAM policies that contain '*' in the Action or/and Resource section. IAM policies control user permissions in AWS. Using '*' in the Action or Resource section grants very broad permissions. This means a user with such a policy could perform almost any action on any resource, bypassing intended security restrictions. This is risky because it increases the attack surface and potential damage if an attacker gains access to those credentials.\n\nIn simpler terms, a '*' wildcard is like giving someone a master key to your entire AWS cloud. It's best to use specific permissions to minimize risk. ",
