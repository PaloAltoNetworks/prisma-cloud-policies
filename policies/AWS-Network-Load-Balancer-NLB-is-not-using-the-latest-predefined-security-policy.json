  "name": "AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) is not using the latest predefined security policy",
  "description": "This policy identifies Network Load Balancers (NLBs) which are not using the latest predefined security policy. A security policy is a combination of protocols and ciphers. The protocol establishes a secure connection between a client and a server and ensures that all data passed between the client and your load balancer is private. A cipher is an encryption algorithm that uses encryption keys to create a coded message. So it is recommended to use the latest predefined security policy which uses only secured protocol and ciphers.\n\nFor more details:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/create-tls-listener.html#describe-ssl-policies",
