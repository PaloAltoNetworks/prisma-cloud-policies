  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Vertex AI Workbench Instances that have Integrity monitoring disabled.\n\nIntegrity Monitoring continuously monitors the boot integrity, kernel integrity, and persistent data integrity of the underlying VM of the shielded workbench instances. It detects unauthorized modifications or tampering, enhancing security by verifying the trusted state of VM components throughout their lifecycle. Integrity monitoring provides active alerts, enabling administrators to respond to integrity failures and prevent compromised nodes from being deployed into the cluster.\n\nIt is recommended to enable Integrity Monitoring for Workbench instances to detect and mitigate advanced threat, such as rootkits and bootkit malware.",
