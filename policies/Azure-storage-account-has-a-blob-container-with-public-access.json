  "name": "Azure storage account has a blob container with public access",
  "description": "Publicly accessible Azure blob containers pose a significant security risk, enabling unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within. This misconfiguration allows anyone on the internet to read or download data without authentication.\n\nAzure Blob Storage offers granular access control through shared access signatures or private endpoints. However, enabling 'Public access level' for a container bypasses these security measures, exposing the container and its contents to untrusted IPs. Attackers could easily exploit this to exfiltrate sensitive data, potentially leading to data breaches and regulatory violations.\n\nThe impact of this misconfiguration includes data breaches, reputational damage, and financial losses. Strict access control is crucial for data protection; allowing public access unnecessarily increases the attack surface. Restricting access to authorized users and entities only minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and data compromise.\n\nTo mitigate this, enforce the principle of least privilege. Disable 'Public access level' for all blob containers. Use shared access signatures (SAS) for controlled, time-limited access to specific data. Consider implementing private endpoints to restrict access to authorized networks. Regularly audit storage account configurations for unintended public access settings.",
