  "name": "Azure storage account has a blob container with public access",
  "description": "This policy identifies blob containers within an Azure storage account that allow anonymous/public access ('CONTAINER' or 'BLOB'). As a best practice, do not allow anonymous/public access to blob containers unless you have a very good reason. Instead, you should consider using a shared access signature token for providing controlled and time-limited access to blob containers.\n\n'Public access level' allows you to grant anonymous/public read access to a container and the blobs within Azure blob storage. By doing so, you can grant read-only access to these resources without sharing your account key, and without requiring a shared access signature.",
