  "name": "Azure Function app configured with public network access",
  "description": "Azure Function apps configured with public network access allows unauthorized access, enabling attackers to exploit misconfigurations and compromise the application. Function apps should only be accessible through controlled networks.\n\nAzure Functions, by default, can be configured with public network access. This setting exposes the function app directly to the internet, increasing the attack surface. Untrusted IPs can directly interact with the function app, leading to potential data breaches, unauthorized code execution, or denial-of-service attacks.\n\nThe impact of this misconfiguration is significant, ranging from data exfiltration and service disruption to complete application compromise. Restricting access to authorized entities only, via private endpoints, minimizes the risk of exploitation and improves overall security posture.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, ensure Azure Function apps are configured with private endpoints, limiting access to trusted networks. Regularly review network configurations and disable public access unless explicitly required. Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for further protection.",
