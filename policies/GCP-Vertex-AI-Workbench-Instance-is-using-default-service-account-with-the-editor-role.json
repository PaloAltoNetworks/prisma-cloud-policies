  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Vertex AI Workbench Instances that are using the default service account with the Editor role.\n\nThe Compute Engine default service account is automatically created with an autogenerated name and email address when you enable the Compute Engine API. By default, this service account is granted the IAM basic Editor role unless you explicitly disable this behavior. If this service account is assigned to a Vertex AI Workbench instance, it may lead to potential privilege escalation.\n\nIn line with the principle of least privilege, it is recommended that Vertex AI Workbench Instances are not assigned the 'Compute Engine default service account', particularly when the Editor role is granted to the service account.",
