  "description": "With Intranode Visibility, all network traffic in your cluster is seen by the Google Cloud Platform network. This means you can see flow logs for all traffic between Pods, including traffic between Pods on the same node. And you can create firewall rules that apply to all traffic between Pods.\n\nThis policy checks your cluster's intra-node visibility feature and generates an alert if it's disabled.",
