  "description": "This policy identifies Amazon ElastiCache Redis clusters where automatic backup is disabled by checking if SnapshotRetentionLimit is less than 1.\n\nAmazon ElastiCache for Redis clusters can back up their data. Automatic backups in ElastiCache Redis clusters ensure data durability and enable point-in-time recovery, protecting against data loss or corruption. Without backups, data loss from breaches or corruption could be irreversible, compromising data integrity and availability.\n\nIt is recommended to enable automatic backups to adhere to compliance requirements and enhance security measures, ensuring data integrity and resilience against potential threats.",
