  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Service bus namespaces configured with overly permissive authorization rules. Service Bus clients should not use a namespace level access policy that provides access to all queues and topics in a namespace. It is recommended to follow the least privileged security model, should create access policies at the entity level for queues and topics to provide access to only the specific entity. All authorization rules except RootManageSharedAccessKey should be removed from the Service bus namespace.\n\n",
