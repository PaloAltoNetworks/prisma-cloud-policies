  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Container Registries that are not encrypted with Customer-Managed Keys (CMK).\n\nBy default, Azure Container Registry encrypts data at rest with Microsoft-managed keys. However, for enhanced control, regulatory compliance, and improved security, customer-managed keys enable organizations to encrypt Azure Container Registry data using Azure Key Vault keys that they create, own, and manage. Using CMK ensures that the encryption process aligns with organizational policies, allowing complete control over key lifecycle management, including rotation, access management, and retirement.\n\nAs a security best practice, it is recommended to encrypt Azure Container Registries with Customer-Managed Keys (CMK).",
