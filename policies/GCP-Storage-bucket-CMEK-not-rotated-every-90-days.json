  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Storage bucket with CMEK that are not rotated every 90 days\n\nA CMEK (Customer-Managed Encryption Key), which is configured for a GCP bucket becomes vulnerable over time due to prolonged use. Without regular rotation, the key is at greater risk of being compromised, which could lead to unauthorized access to the encrypted data in the bucket. This can undermine the security of your data and increase the chances of a breach if the key is exposed or exploited.\n\nIt is recommended to configure rotation less than 90 days for CMEKs used for GCP buckets.",
