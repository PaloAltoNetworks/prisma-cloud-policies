  "description": "This policy identifies the GKE node version and generates an alert if the version running is unsupported.\n\nUsing an unsupported version of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) can lead to several potential issues and risks, such as security vulnerabilities, compatibility issues, performance and stability problems, and compliance concerns. To mitigate these risks, it's crucial to regularly update the GKE clusters to supported versions recommended by Google Cloud.\n\nAs a security best practice, it is always recommended to use the latest version of GKE.\n\nNote: The Policy updates will be made as per the release schedule https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-schedule#schedule-for-release-channels",
