  "description": "This policy identifies GCP BigQuery tables that are not encrypted with Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK).\n\nCMEK for BigQuery tables provides control over the encryption of data at rest. Encrypting BigQuery tables with CMEK enhances security by giving you full control over encryption keys. This ensures data protection, especially for sensitive models and predictions. CMEK allows key rotation and revocation, aligning with compliance requirements and offering better data privacy management.\n\nIt is recommended to use CMEK for BigQuery table encryption.",
