  "description": "This policy identifies Azure App Services that are not configured with managed service identity. Managed Service Identity in App Service makes the app more secure by eliminating secrets from the app, such as credentials in the connection strings. When registering with Azure Active Directory in the app service, the app will connect to other Azure services securely without the need for username and passwords.",
