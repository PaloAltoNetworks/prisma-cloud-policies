  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Storage Accounts storing Cognitive service diagnostic logs are publicly accessible.\n\nAzure Storage account stores Cognitive service diagnostic logs which might contain detailed information of platform logs, resource logs, trace logs and metrics. Diagnostic log data may contain sensitive data and helps in identifying potentially malicious activity. The attacker could exploit publicly accessible storage account to get cognitive diagnostic data logs and could breach into the system by leveraging exposed data and propagate across your system.\n\nAs a best security practice, it is recommended to restrict storage account access to only the services as per business requirement.",
