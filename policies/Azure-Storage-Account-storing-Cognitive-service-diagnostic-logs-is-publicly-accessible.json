  "name": "Azure Storage Account storing Cognitive service diagnostic logs is publicly accessible",
  "description": "Publicly accessible Azure Storage Accounts storing Cognitive service diagnostic logs present a significant security risk. These logs may contain sensitive information, including platform, resource, trace, and metric data, potentially providing attackers with details to carry out malicious activities.\n\nAzure Storage Accounts are used to store Cognitive service diagnostic logs. If improperly configured with public access, attackers can easily retrieve this sensitive log data. This access could enable attackers to understand system architecture, identify vulnerabilities, and subsequently compromise the system.\n\nCompromise of diagnostic logs could lead to data breaches, service disruptions, and significant reputational damage. Restricting access to only authorized services ensures that sensitive data remains protected and limits the potential impact of a breach.\n\nMitigate this risk by configuring your Azure Storage Accounts to only allow access from trusted IP addresses or specific services. Regularly review and update access control lists to maintain a strong security posture and minimize your attack surface.",
