  "description": "This policy identifies OCI Security lists that allow unrestricted ingress access to port 3389. It is recommended that no security list allows unrestricted ingress access to port 3389. As a best practice, remove unfettered connectivity to remote console services, such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), to reduce server's exposure to risk.",
