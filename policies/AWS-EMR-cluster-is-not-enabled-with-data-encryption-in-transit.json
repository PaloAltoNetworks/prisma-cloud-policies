  "description": "This policy identifies AWS EMR clusters which are not enabled with data encryption in transit. It is highly recommended to implement in-transit encryption in order to protect data from unauthorized access as it travels through the network, between clients and storage server. Enabling data encryption in-transit helps prevent unauthorized users from reading sensitive data between your EMR clusters and their associated storage systems.",
