  "description": "This policy identifies AWS Cognito identity pools that allow unauthenticated guest access.\n\nAWS Cognito identity pools unauthenticated guest access and allows unauthenticated users to assume a role in your AWS account. These unauthenticated users will be granted permissions of the assumed role which may have more privileges than that are intended. This could lead to unauthorized access or data leakage.\n\nIt is recommended to disable unauthenticated guest access for the Cognito identity pools.",
