  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Storage accounts not configured with SAS expiration policy.\n\nA Shared Access Signature (SAS) expiration policy specifies a recommended interval over which the SAS is valid. SAS expiration policies apply to a service SAS or an account SAS. When a user generates service SAS or an account SAS with a validity interval that is larger than the recommended interval, they'll see a warning. If Azure Storage logging with Azure Monitor is enabled, then an entry is written to the Azure Storage logs. It is recommended that you limit the interval for a SAS in case it is compromised.\n\nFor more details:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/sas-expiration-policy",
