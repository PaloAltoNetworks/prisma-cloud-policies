  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks that are using the default service account with the editor role.\n\nWhen you create a new Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebook, the compute engine default service account is associated with the notebook by default if any other service account is not configured. The compute engine default service account is automatically created when the Compute Engine API is enabled and is granted the IAM basic Editor role if you have not disabled this behavior explicitly. These permissions can be exploited to get admin access to the GCP project.\n\nTo be compliant with the principle of least privileges and prevent potential privilege escalation, it is recommended that Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks are not assigned the 'Compute Engine default service account' especially when the editor role is granted to the service account.",
