  "description": "This policy identifies Azure SQL databases which have Defender setting set to Off. Azure Defender for SQL provides a new layer of security, which enables customers to detect and respond to potential threats as they occur by providing security alerts on anomalous activities. Users will receive an alert upon suspicious database activities, potential vulnerabilities, SQL injection attacks, as well as anomalous database access patterns. Advanced threat protection alerts provide details of suspicious activity and recommend action on how to investigate and mitigate the threat.",
