  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Cloud SQL instances with public IP addresses that do not have an authorized network configured.\n\nSQL instance can be connected securely by making use of the Cloud SQL Proxy or by adding the client's public addresses as an authorized network to the SQL instance. If the client application is connecting directly to a Cloud SQL instance on its public IP address, the client's external IP address needs to be added as an Authorized network to allow the secure connection.\n\nIt is recommended to add authorized networks for your SQL instance to minimize the access vector.",
