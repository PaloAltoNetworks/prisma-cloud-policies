Because an ECS instance receives a public IP address at the launch, by default, as a best practice ensure that the instance is attached to a security group which is not overly permissive.",

Check the rules of each security group by clicking on 'Add Rules' in the Actions column\n5. In Inbound tab, Select the rule having 'Action' as Allow and 'Authorization Object' as 0.0.0.0/0, Click Modify in the Actions column\n6.
