  "name": "Azure Network Security Group having Inbound rule overly permissive to HTTP(S) traffic",
  "description": "This policy identifies Network Security Groups (NSGs) that have inbound rules allowing overly permissive access to HTTP or HTTPS traffic.\n\nA network security group contains a list of security rules that allow or deny inbound or outbound network traffic based on source or destination IP address, port, and protocol. Overly permissive inbound rules for HTTP(S) traffic increase the risk of unauthorized access and potential attacks on your network resources. This can lead to data breaches, exposure of sensitive information, and other security incidents.\n\nAs a best practice, it is recommended to configure NSGs to restrict HTTP(S) traffic to only necessary and trusted IP addresses.",
