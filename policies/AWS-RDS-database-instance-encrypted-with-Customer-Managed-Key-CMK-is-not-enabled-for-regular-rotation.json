  "description": "This policy identifies Amazon RDS instances that use Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) for encryption but are not enabled with key rotation. Amazon RDS instance encryption key rotation failure can result in prolonged exposure of sensitive data and potential compliance violations. As a security best practice, it is important to periodically rotate these keys. This ensures that if the keys are compromised, the data in the underlying service remains secure with the new keys.",
