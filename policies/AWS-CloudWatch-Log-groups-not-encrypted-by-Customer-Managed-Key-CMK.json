  "name": "AWS CloudWatch Log groups not encrypted by Customer Managed Key (CMK)",
  "description": "This policy identifies AWS CloudWatch Log groups that are encrypted using the default KMS key instead of CMK (Customer Managed Key) or using a CMK that is disabled.\n\nA CloudWatch Log Group is a collection of log streams that share the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings. Encrypting with a Customer Managed Key (CMK) provides additional control over key rotation, management, and access policies compared to the default encryption.\n\nAs a security best practice, using CMK to encrypt your CloudWatch Log Groups is advisable as it gives you full control over the encrypted data.",
