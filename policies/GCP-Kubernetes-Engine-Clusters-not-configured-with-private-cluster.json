So to fix this alert, Create a new cluster with a private cluster configured on it and migrate all required data from reported cluster to the newly created cluster.\n\n1. Login to GCP Portal\n2. Click on 'CREATE CLUSTER'\n3. Choose the required name/value for other cluster fields\n4. Click on 'Advanced options'\n5. Under the Networking section, Check the 'Enable VPC-native (using alias IP)' option\n6. Choose the required Network, Node subnet parameters\n7. In the Network security section, Check the 'Private cluster' option\n8. Set 'Master IP range' to as per your required IP range\n9. Click on 'Create'\nNOTE: When you create a private cluster, you must specify a /28 CIDR range for the VMs that run the Kubernetes master components. You also need to enable IP aliases.",
