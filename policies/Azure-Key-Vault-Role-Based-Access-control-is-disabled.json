  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Key Vault instances where Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is not enabled.\n\nWithout RBAC, managing access is less secure and can lead to improper access permissions, increasing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data. RBAC provides finer-grained access control, enabling secure and manageable permissions for key vault secrets, keys, and certificates. This allows for detailed permissions and the use of privileged identity management for enhanced security with Just-In-Time (JIT) access management.\n\nAs best practice, it is recommended to enable RBAC for all Azure Key Vaults to ensure secure and manageable access control.",
