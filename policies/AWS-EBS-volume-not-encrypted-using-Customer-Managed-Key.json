So to resolve this alert, create a new EBS Volume with encryption enabled with customer managed key, then migrate all required volume data from the reported volume to this newly created volume and delete reported EBS volume.\n\nTo create new EBS volume with encryption enabled with customer managed key, perform the following:\n1.
