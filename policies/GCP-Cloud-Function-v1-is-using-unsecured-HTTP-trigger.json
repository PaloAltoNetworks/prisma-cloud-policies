  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Cloud Functions v1 that are using unsecured HTTP trigger.\n\nUsing HTTP triggers for cloud functions poses significant security risks, including vulnerability to interception, tampering, and various attacks like man-in-the-middle. Conversely, HTTPS triggers provide encrypted communication, safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring confidentiality. HTTPS also supports authentication mechanisms, enhancing overall security and trust.\n\nIt is recommended to enable 'Require HTTPS' for HTTP triggers for all cloud functions v1.",
