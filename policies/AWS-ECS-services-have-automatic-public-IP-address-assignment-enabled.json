Assigning public IP addresses to ECS services may expose them to the internet. If the services are not adequately secured or have vulnerabilities, they could be susceptible to unauthorized access, DDoS attacks, or other malicious activities. It is recommended that the Amazon ECS environment not have an associated public IP address except for limited edge cases.",
