  "description": "This policy identifies AWS VPC gateway endpoints that have a VPC endpoint (VPCE) policy that is overly permissive. When the Principal element value is set to '*' within the access policy, the VPC gateway endpoint allows full access to any IAM user or service within the VPC using credentials from any AWS accounts. It is highly recommended to have the least privileged VPCE policy to protect the data leakage and unauthorized access.\n\nFor more details:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-access.html",

On the 'Actions' drop-down button, click on the 'Manage policy'\n8. On the 'Edit Policy' page, Choose 'Custom' policy\na. Then add policy, without the 'Everyone' grantee (i.e. '*' or 'AWS': '*') from the Principal element value with an AWS account ID (e.g. '123456789'), an AWS account ARN (e.g. 'arn:aws:iam::123456789:root') or an IAM user ARN (e.g. 'arn:aws:iam::123456789:user/vpce-admin').\nb. Add a Condition clause to the policy statement to filter the endpoint access to specific entities.\n9. Click on 'Save'",
