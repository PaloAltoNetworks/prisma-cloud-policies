  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Service accounts that are publicly accessible.\n\nGCP Service accounts are intended to be used by an application or compute workload, rather than a person. It can be granted permission to perform actions in the GCP project as any other GCP user. Allowing access to 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' over a service account would allow unwanted access to the public and could lead to a security breach.\n\nAs a security best practice, follow the Principle of Least Privilege and grant permissions to entities only on a need basis. It is recommended to avoid granting permission to 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers'.",
