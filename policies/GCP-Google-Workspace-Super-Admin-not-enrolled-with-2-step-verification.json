  "description": "This policy identifies Google Workspace Super Admins that do not have 2-Step Verification enabled. \n\nSuper Admin accounts have access to all features in the Admin console and Admin API. This additional layer of 2SV significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, protecting administrative controls and sensitive data from potential breaches. Implementing 2-Step Verification safeguards your entire Google Workspace environment, maintaining robust security and compliance standards.\n\nIt is recommended to enable 2-Step Verification for all Super Admins as it provides an additional layer of security in case account credentials are compromised.",
