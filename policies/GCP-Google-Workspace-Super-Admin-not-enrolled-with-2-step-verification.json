  "description": "Super Admin accounts in Google Workspace lacking 2-step verification (2SV) pose a significant security risk. These accounts possess extensive privileges, allowing unauthorized access to critical data and settings if compromised.\n\nThe Google Workspace Super Admin role grants complete control over the Admin console and API. Without 2SV, a stolen password grants immediate and total access to the organization's data, potentially leading to data breaches, account hijacking, and service disruptions. Compromise of these accounts enables attackers to modify configurations, delete data, and deploy malware.\n\nA successful attack on an unprotected Super Admin account could result in catastrophic data loss, financial damage, and reputational harm. Enforcing 2SV for Super Admins is crucial to mitigate this risk; it adds an extra layer of authentication, limiting unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised.\n\nImplement mandatory 2SV for all Google Workspace Super Admin accounts. Regularly audit account security settings to ensure compliance. Consider using strong password policies and other multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods alongside 2SV for enhanced protection.",
