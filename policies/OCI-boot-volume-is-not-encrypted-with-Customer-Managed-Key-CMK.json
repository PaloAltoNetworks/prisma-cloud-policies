  "description": "This policy identifies OCI boot volumes that are not encrypted with a Customer Managed Key (CMK).\n\nEncrypting boot volumes with a CMK enhances data security by providing an additional layer of protection. Effective management of encryption keys is crucial for safeguarding and accessing sensitive data. Customers should review boot volumes encrypted with Oracle service managed keys to determine if they prefer managing keys for specific volumes and implement their own key lifecycle management accordingly.\n\nAs best practice, it is recommended to encrypt OCI boot volumes using a Customer Managed Key (CMK) to strengthen data security measures.",
