  "description": "This policy identifies Cosmos DBs that allow traffic from public Azure datacenters. If you enable this option, the IP address 0.0.0.0 is added to the list of allowed IP addresses. The list of IPs allowed by this option is wide, so it limits the effectiveness of a firewall policy. So it is recommended not to select the ‘Accept connections from within public Azure datacenters’ option for your Cosmos DB. ",
