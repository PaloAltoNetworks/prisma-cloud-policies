  "description": "This policy identifies AWS Application Load Balancers (ALBs) that are not configured with AWS Web Application Firewall v2 (AWS WAFv2). As a best practice, configure the AWS WAFv2 service on the application load balancers to protect against application-layer attacks. To block malicious requests to your application load balancers, define the block criteria in the WAFv2 web access control list (web ACL).",
