  "name": "Azure Network Security Group having Inbound rule overly permissive to all traffic on any protocol",
  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) which are overly permissive to all traffic on any protocol. A network security group contains a list of security rules that allow or deny inbound or outbound network traffic based on source or destination IP address, port, and protocol. As a best practice, it is recommended to configure NSGs to restrict traffic from known sources, allowing only authorized protocols and ports.",

Select 'All services'.\n3. Select 'Network security groups', under NETWORKING.\n4. Select the Network security group you need to modify.\n5. Select 'Inbound security rules' under Settings.\n6. Select the rule you need to modify, and edit it to allow specific IP addresses and Port ranges OR set the 'Action' to 'Deny' OR 'Delete' the rule based on your requirement.\n7. 'Save' your changes.",
