  "name": "AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) is not using the latest predefined security policy",
  "description": "This policy identifies Application Load Balancers (ALBs) are not using the latest predefined security policy. A security policy is a combination of protocols and ciphers. The protocol establishes a secure connection between a client and a server and ensures that all data passed between the client and your load balancer is private. A cipher is an encryption algorithm that uses encryption keys to create a coded message. So it is recommended to use the latest predefined security policy which uses only secured protocol and ciphers.\n\nWe recommend using either non-FIPS security policy ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-2021-06 or FIPS security policy ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-FIPS-2023-04 to meet compliance and security standards that require disabling certain TLS protocol versions or to support legacy clients that require deprecated ciphers.\n\nFor more details:\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-https-listener.html#describe-ssl-policies",

Go to the EC2 Dashboard, and select 'Load Balancers'\n\n4. Click on the reported Load Balancer\n\n5. On the 'Listeners' tab, Choose the 'HTTPS' or 'SSL' rule\n\n6. Click on 'Edit Listener' in the 'Manage listener' dropdown, Change 'Security policy' to 'ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-2021-06' (non-FIPS) or 'ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-FIPS-2023-04' (FIPS) to meet compliance and security standards that require disabling certain TLS protocol versions or to support legacy clients that require deprecated ciphers.\n\n7.
