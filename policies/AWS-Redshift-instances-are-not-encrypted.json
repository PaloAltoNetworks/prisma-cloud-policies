So to resolve this alert, create a new instance with encryption enabled, then migrate all required file data from the reported Redshift instances to this newly created Redshift instance and delete reported instances.\n1. Sign in to the AWS Admin Console and Access the Redshift service.\n2. Click on the identified Redshift cluster and take a snapshot of it.\n3. Create a new Redshift cluster (now with 'Encryption' set to 'Yes' during creation time) and use the snapshot to populate (restore) the new cluster.\n4. Once the new cluster is populated, delete the older cluster (without encryption).",
