  "description": "This policy identifies the AWS regions that do not have a log metric filter and alarm for security group changes.\n\nSecurity groups act as virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic to AWS resources. If changes to these groups go unmonitored, it could result in unauthorized access or expose sensitive data to the public internet.\n\nIt is recommended to create a metric filter and alarm for security group changes to promptly detect and respond to any unauthorized modifications, thereby maintaining the integrity and security of your AWS environment.\n\nNOTE: This policy will trigger an alert if you have at least one Cloudtrail with the multi-trail enabled, Logs all management events in your account, and is not set with a specific log metric filter and alarm.",
