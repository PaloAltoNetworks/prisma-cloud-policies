  "description": "This policy identifies Storage Sync Services configured with overly permissive network access.\n\nA Storage Sync Service is a management construct that represents registered servers and sync groups. Allowing all traffic to the Sync Service may allow a bad actor to brute force their way into the system and potentially get access to the entire network. With a private endpoint, the network traffic path is secured on both ends and access is restricted to only defined authorized entities.\n\nIt is recommended to configure the Storage Sync Service with private endpoints to minimize the access vector.",
