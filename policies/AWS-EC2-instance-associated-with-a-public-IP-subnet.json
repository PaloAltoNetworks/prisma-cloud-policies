  "description": "This policy identifies the EC2 instances which are associated with a public IP subnet. Using public IP subnet automatically or on launch can accidentally expose the instances within this subnet to the internet. It is a best practice to ensure that there are no EC2 instances with public IP subnet which have internet access.",
