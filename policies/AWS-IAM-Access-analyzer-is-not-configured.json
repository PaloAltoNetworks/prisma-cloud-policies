  "description": "This policy identifies AWS regions in which the IAM Access analyzer is not configured. AWS IAM Access Analyzer helps you identify the resources in your organization and accounts, such as Amazon S3 buckets or IAM roles, that are shared with an external entity and identify unintended access to your resources and data. So it is recommended to configure the Access analyzer in all regions in your account.\n\nNOTE: Access Analyzer analyzes only policies that are applied to resources in the same AWS Region that it's enabled in. To monitor all resources in your AWS environment, you must create an analyzer to enable Access Analyzer in each Region where you're using supported AWS resources.\n\nFor more details:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html",
