  "description": "This policy identifies Lambda Functions that have overly permissive resource-based policy. Lambda functions having overly permissive policy could lead to lateral movement in account or privilege being escalated when compromised. It is highly recommended to have the least privileged access policy to protect the Lambda Functions from unauthorized access.\n\nFor more details:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-resource-based.html",
