  "name": "AWS S3 bucket policy overly permissive to any principal",
  "description": "Overly permissive AWS S3 bucket policies allow unauthorized access to sensitive data. This misconfiguration exposes data to any principal, bypassing intended access controls.\n\nAWS S3 buckets store data; a policy granting AWS 'full access' or '*' allows any user or service to read, write, and delete objects. Untrusted actors could exploit this to exfiltrate sensitive data, modify or delete files, or even perform ransomware attacks.\n\nThe impact of this misconfiguration includes data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. Restricting access to only authorized users and services using the principle of least privilege minimizes the impact of a compromised account. Strong access control is crucial for data protection.\n\nImplement least privilege by granting only necessary permissions to specific users and services. Regularly review and update bucket policies, ensuring that only authorized entities have access. Enable Block Public Access settings to prevent unintended public exposure. Use fine-grained access control mechanisms like IAM roles and policies to further enhance security.",
