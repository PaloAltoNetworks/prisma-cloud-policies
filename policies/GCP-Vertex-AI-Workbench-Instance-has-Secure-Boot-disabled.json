  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Vertex AI Workbench instances with Secure Boot disabled.\n\nSecure Boot is a security feature that ensures only trusted, digitally signed software runs during the boot process, protecting against advanced threats such as rootkits and bootkits. By verifying the integrity of the bootloader and operating system, Secure Boot prevents unauthorized software from compromising the system at startup. Without Secure Boot, instances are vulnerable to persistent malware and unauthorized code that could compromise the system deeply.\n\nIt is recommended to enable Secure Boot for Vertex AI Workbench instances.",
