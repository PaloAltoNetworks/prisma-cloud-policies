Visit the Network path Analysis from Source to Destination and review the network path components that allow internet access.\n2. Identify the network component on which restrictive rules can be implemented.\n3. Implement the required changes and make sure no other resources have been impacted due to these changes:\n a) The overly permissive Security Group rules can be made more restrictive.\n b) Move the instance inside a restrictive subnet if the instance does not need to have outbound access to the internet.\n c) Define a NAT rule to restrict traffic going to the Internet from the respective instance.",
