  "description": "This policy identifies Resource Access Management (RAM) users who have both console access and access keys. When a RAM user is created, the Administrator can assign either console access or access keys or both. As a best practice, it is recommended to assign console access to users and access keys for system / API applications, but not both to the same RAM user.",
