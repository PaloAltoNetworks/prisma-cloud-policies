  "description": "This policy identifies AWS Network ACLs that are not in use. \n\nAWS Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) serve as a firewall mechanism to regulate traffic flow within and outside VPC subnets. A recommended practice is to assign NACLs to specific subnets to effectively manage network traffic. Unassigned NACLs with inadequate rules might inadvertently get linked to subnets, posing a security risk by potentially allowing unauthorized access.\n\nIt is recommended to regularly review and remove unused and inadequate NACLs to improve security, network performance, and resource management.",
