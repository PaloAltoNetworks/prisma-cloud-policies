  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Virtual Network (VNet) subnets that are not associated with a Network Security Group (NSG).\n\nWhile binding an NSG to a network interface of a Virtual Machine (VM) enables fine-grained control of the VM, associating an NSG to a subnet enables better control over network traffic to all resources within a subnet.\n\nIt is recommended to associate an NSG with a subnet so that you can protect your VMs on a subnet-level.\n\nFor more information,\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/archive/blogs/igorpag/azure-network-security-groups-nsg-best-practices-and-lessons-learned\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview#limitations\n\nNote: This policy will not report for subnets used by Azure Firewall Subnet, Azure Firewall Management Subnet, Gateway Subnet, NetApp File Share, Route Server Subnet, Private endpoints and Private links as Azure recommends not to configure Network Security Group (NSG) for these services.",
