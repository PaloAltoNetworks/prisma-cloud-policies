  "description": "This policy identifies AWS ECR private repositories whose tag immutability is not configured.\n\nAWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) tag immutability ensures that once an image is pushed to a repository with tag immutability enabled, the tag cannot be overwritten or updated. This feature is useful for ensuring the security, integrity, and reliability of container images in production environments. It prevents tags from being overwritten, which can help prevent unauthorised changes to images.\n\nIt is recommended to enable tag immutability on ECR repositories to maintain the integrity and security of the images pushed.",
