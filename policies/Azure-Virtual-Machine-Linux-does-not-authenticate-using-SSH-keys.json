  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Virtual Machines that have basic authentication, not authenticating using SSH keys. Azure Virtual Machines with basic authentication could allow attackers to brute force and gain unauthorized access, which might lead to potential data leaks. It is recommended to use SSH keys for authentication to avoid brute force attacks on virtual machines.",
