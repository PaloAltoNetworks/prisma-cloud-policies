  "description": "This policy identifies AWS S3 access points with the block public access setting disabled.\n\nAWS S3 Access Point simplifies managing data access by creating unique access control policies for specific applications or users within a S3 bucket. The Amazon S3 Block Public Access feature manages access at the account, bucket, and access point levels. Each level's settings can be configured independently but cannot override more restrictive settings at higher levels. Instead, access point settings complement those at the account and bucket levels.\n\nIt is recommended to enable the Block public access setting on a S3 access point unless intended for public exposure.",
