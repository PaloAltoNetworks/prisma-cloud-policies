  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Firewall rules which allow inbound traffic from anywhere with no target filtering. \n\nThe default target is all instances in the network. The use of target tags or target service accounts allows the rule to apply to select instances. Not using any firewall rule filtering may allow a bad actor to brute force their way into the system and potentially get access to the entire network.",

Go to the Firewall rules.\n4. Click on each Firewall rule reported.\n5. Click Edit.\n6. Change the Targets field from 'All instances in the network' to 'Specified target tags' or 'Specified service account'.\n7. Type the target tag/target service account into the Target tags/Target service account field respectively.\n8. Review Source IP ranges and change to specific IP ranges if traffic is not required to be allowed from anywhere.\n9.
