  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Machine Learning workspaces that are not configured with a user-assigned managed identity.\n\nBy default, Azure Machine Learning workspaces use system-assigned managed identities to access resources like Azure Container Registry, Key Vault, Storage, and Application Insights. However, user-assigned managed identities offer better control over the identity's lifecycle and consistent access management across multiple resources. Since system-assigned identities are tied to the workspace and deleted if the workspace is removed, using a user-assigned identity allows access management independently, enhancing security and compliance.\n\nAs a security best practice, it is recommended to configure the Azure Machine Learning workspace with a user-assigned managed identity.",

  "recommendation": "Method 1: Updating an Existing Workspace\n1. Once an Azure Machine Learning workspace is created with a System-Managed Identity, you cannot change it to use only a User-Assigned Managed Identity. You can update the workspace to use both System-Managed and User-Assigned Managed Identities.\n2. For detailed instructions on how to configure this, visit the following URL: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-identity-based-service-authentication?view=azureml-api-2&tabs=cli#add-a-user-assigned-managed-identity-to-a-workspace-in-addition-to-a-system-assigned-identity\n\nor\n\nMethod 2: Deleting the Existing Workspace and Creating a New Workspace\n1. To use only a User-Assigned Managed Identity, delete the existing workspace.  \n2. Create a new Azure Machine Learning workspace. During the setup, select 'User Assigned Identity' under the 'Identity' tab to ensure it exclusively uses a User-Assigned Managed Identity from the start.",
