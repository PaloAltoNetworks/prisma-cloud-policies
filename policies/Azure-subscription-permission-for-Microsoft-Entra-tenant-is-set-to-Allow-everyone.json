  "description": "Unrestricted Azure subscription access to the Microsoft Entra tenant allows any user to add or remove subscriptions, creating a significant security risk. This misconfiguration enables unauthorized access and potential data breaches.\n\nThe 'Subscription entering Microsoft Entra tenant' and 'Subscription leaving Microsoft Entra tenant' settings within Azure govern the ability of subscriptions to join or leave the Microsoft Entra tenant. Leaving these settings at 'Allow everyone' bypasses access controls, potentially allowing malicious actors to add compromised subscriptions, exfiltrating data or deploying malware.\n\nThe impact of this misconfiguration is the potential for unauthorized access to Azure resources associated with added subscriptions. Restricting access ensures only authorized subscriptions can interact with the tenant, thus mitigating the risk of data breaches and unauthorized resource manipulation. A strong security posture mandates careful control over subscription lifecycle management.\n\nTo remediate, configure both 'Subscription entering Microsoft Entra tenant' and 'Subscription leaving Microsoft Entra tenant' permissions to 'Permit no one'. Then, explicitly grant these permissions only to authorized users or service principals through role-based access control (RBAC), ensuring a least-privilege model for managing tenant subscription access.",
