Allowing subscriptions to enter or leave the Microsoft Entra tenant without restrictions can expose the organization to unauthorized access and potential security breaches.\n\nAs best practice, it is recommended to configure the settings for 'Subscription entering Microsoft Entra tenant' and 'Subscription leaving Microsoft Entra tenant' to 'Permit no one' to ensure only authorized subscriptions can interact with the tenant, thus enhancing the security of your Azure environment.",
