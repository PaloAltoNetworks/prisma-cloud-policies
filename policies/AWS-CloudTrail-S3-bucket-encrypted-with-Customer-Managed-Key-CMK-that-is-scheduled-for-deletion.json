  "description": "This policy identifies AWS CloudTrail S3 buckets encrypted with Customer Managed Key (CMK) that is scheduled for deletion.\n\nCloudTrail logs contain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. These log files stored in Amazon S3 are encrypted by AWS KMS keys. Deleting keys in AWS KMS that are used by CloudTrail is a common defense evasion technique and could be a potential ransomware attacker activity. After a key is deleted, you can no longer decrypt the data that was encrypted under that key, which helps the attacker to hide their malicious activities.\n\nIt is recommended to regularly monitor the key used for encryption to prevent accidental deletion.",
