  "name": "AWS CloudTrail S3 bucket encrypted with Customer Managed Key (CMK) that is scheduled for deletion",
  "description": "AWS CloudTrail S3 buckets encrypted with Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) scheduled for deletion pose a significant security risk. The deletion of these CMKs prevents decryption of CloudTrail logs, hindering security monitoring and incident response.\n\nCloudTrail logs, stored in S3 buckets and encrypted using CMKs, record crucial account activity. Deleting the CMK renders these logs inaccessible, effectively concealing malicious actions such as data exfiltration or lateral movement. An attacker could leverage this misconfiguration to evade detection and maintain persistence.\n\nCompromised CloudTrail logs due to CMK deletion leave organizations blind to security incidents. Maintaining the integrity and accessibility of CloudTrail logs is crucial for effective threat detection and incident response. Data breaches, compromised credentials, and ransomware attacks could go undetected, leading to significant financial and reputational damage.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, implement robust CMK lifecycle management. Regularly review scheduled CMK deletions, ensuring that they are intentional and necessary. Establish a process for securely rotating CMKs and consider using AWS KMS key rotation capabilities. Implement logging and alerting for CMK deletion attempts to provide timely notification of suspicious activity.",
