  "description": "This policy identifies if the Data Access Authentication Mode for Azure disks is disabled. This mode is crucial for controlling how users upload or export Virtual Machine Disks by requiring an Azure Entra ID role to authorize such operations.\n\nWithout enabling this mode, users can create SAS tokens to export disks without stringent identity-based restrictions. This increases the risk of unauthorized disk access or data exposure, especially in environments handling sensitive data. Enabling the Data Access Authentication Mode ensures that only users with the appropriate Data Operator for Managed Disk role in Azure Entra ID can export or manage disks. This enhances data security by preventing unauthorized disk exports and restricting access to secure download URLs.\n\nAs a security best practice, it is recommended to enable data access authentication mode for Azure disks.",
