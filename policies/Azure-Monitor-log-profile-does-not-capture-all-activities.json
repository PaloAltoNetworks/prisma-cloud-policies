  "description": "This policy identifies the Monitor log profiles which are not configured to capture all activities. A log profile controls how the activity log is exported. Configuring the log profile to collect logs for the categories 'Write', 'Delete' and 'Action' ensures that all the control/management plane activities performed on the subscription are exported.",

To list the Log profile run,\naz monitor log-profiles list\n\n2. Note the name of reported log profile and replace it with <LOG_PROFILE_NAME> in below command:\naz account get-access-token --query \"{subscription:subscription,accessToken:accessToken}\" --out tsv | xargs -L1 bash -c 'curl -X GET -H \"Authorization: Bearer $1\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/$0/providers/microsoft.insights/logprofiles/<LOG_PROFILE_NAME>?api-version=2016-03-01' | jq\nCopy the JSON output and save it as 'input.json' file.\n\n3. Edit the saved 'input.json' file to add all activities 'Write', 'Delete' and 'Action' in categories JSON array section.\n\n4.
