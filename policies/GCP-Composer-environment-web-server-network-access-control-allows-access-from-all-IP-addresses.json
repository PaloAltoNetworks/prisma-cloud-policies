  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Composer environments with web server network access control that allows access from all IP addresses.\n\nWeb server network access control defines which IP addresses will have access to the Airflow web server. By default, web server network access control is set to allow all connections from the public internet. Allowing all traffic to the composer environment may allow a bad actor to brute force their way into the system and potentially get access to the entire network.\n\nAs a best practice, restrict traffic solely from known IP addresses and limit access to known hosts, services, or specific entities only.",

Click the 'Save' button.\n\nTo configure web server network access of a new Cloud Composer 1 environment, please refer to the URLs given below:\nhttps://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/how-to/managing/creating#web-server-access\n\nTo configure web server network access of a new Cloud Composer 2 environment, please refer to the URLs given below:\nhttps://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/create-environments#web-server-access\n\nNote: Cloud Composer 1 is nearing the end of support. The creation of new Cloud Composer 1 environments might be restricted. Further, updates to the existing Cloud Composer 1 environment may be restricted. In such cases, it is recommended to migrate to Cloud Composer 2. To migrate to Cloud Composer 2, please refer to the URLs given below and configure web server network access to limit the access for the new environment:\nhttps://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/migrate-composer-2-snapshots-af-2",
