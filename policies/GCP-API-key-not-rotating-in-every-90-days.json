  "description": "This policy identifies GCP API keys for which the creation date is aged more than 90 days. Google recommends using the standard authentication flow instead of API Keys. However, there are limited cases where API keys are more appropriate. API keys should be rotated to ensure that data cannot be accessed with an old key that might have been lost, cracked, or stolen.",
