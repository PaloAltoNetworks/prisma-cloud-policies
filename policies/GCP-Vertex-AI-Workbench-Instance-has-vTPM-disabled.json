  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Vertex AI Workbench Instances that have the Virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) feature disabled.\n\nThe Virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) validates the guest VM's pre-boot and boot integrity and provides key generation and protection. The root keys of the vTPM, as well as the keys it generates, cannot leave the vTPM, thereby offering enhanced protection against compromised operating systems or highly privileged project administrators.\n\nIt is recommended to enable the virtual TPM device on GCP Vertex AI Workbench Instances to support measured boot and other OS security features that require a TPM.",
