  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Firewall rule allowing all traffic on port 10250 which allows GKE full node access. The port 10250 on the kubelet is used by the kube-apiserver (running on hosts labelled as Orchestration Plane) for exec and logs. As per security best practice, port 10250 should not be exposed to the public.",
