  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Firewall rule allowing all traffic on port 10250 which allows GKE full node access. The port 10250 on the kubelet is used by the kube-apiserver (running on hosts labelled as Orchestration Plane) for exec and logs. As per security best practice, port 10250 should not be exposed to the public.",

Login to GCP Console\n2. Navigate to 'VPC Network'(Left Panel)\n3. Go to the 'Firewall' section (Left Panel)\n4. Click on the reported Firewall rule\n5. Click on 'EDIT'\n6.
