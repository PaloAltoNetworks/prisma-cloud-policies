  "name": "Azure Application Gateway listener not secured with SSL profile",
  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Application Gateway listeners that are not secured with an SSL profile.\n\nAn SSL profile provides a secure channel by encrypting the data transferred between the client and the application gateway. Without SSL profiles, the data transferred is vulnerable to interception, posing security risks. This could lead to potential data breaches and compromise sensitive information.\n\nAs a security best practice, it is recommended to secure all Application Gateway listeners with SSL profiles. This ensures data confidentiality and integrity by encrypting traffic.",
