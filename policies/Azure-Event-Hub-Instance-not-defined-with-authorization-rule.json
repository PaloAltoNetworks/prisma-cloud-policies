  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Event Hub Instances that are not defined with authorization rules.\n\nIf the Azure Event Hub Instance authorization rule is not defined, there is a heightened risk of unauthorized access to the event hub data and resources. This could potentially lead to unauthorized data retrieval, tampering, or disruption of the event hub operations. Defining proper authorization rules helps mitigate these risks by controlling and restricting access to the event hub resources.\n\nAs a best practice, it is recommended to define the least privilege security model access policies at Event Hub Instance.",
