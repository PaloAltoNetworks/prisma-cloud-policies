  "description": " This policy identifies the S3 Bucket(s) which will allow any unauthenticated user to PUT objects into a bucket. These permissions permit anyone, malicious or not, to PUT objects into your S3 bucket if they can guess the namespace. Since the S3 service does not protect the namespace other than with ACLs and Bucket Policy, you risk compromise of critical data by leaving this open.",
