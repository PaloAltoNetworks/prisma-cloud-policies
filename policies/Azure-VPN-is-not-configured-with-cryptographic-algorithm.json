  "description": "This policy identifies Azure VPNs which are not configured with cryptographic algorithm. Azure VPN gateways to use a custom IPsec/IKE policy with specific cryptographic algorithms and key strengths, rather than the Azure default policy sets. IPsec and IKE protocol standard supports a wide range of cryptographic algorithms in various combinations. If customers do not request a specific combination of cryptographic algorithms and parameters, Azure VPN gateways use a set of default proposals. Typically due to compliance or security requirements, you can now configure your Azure VPN gateways to use a custom IPsec/IKE policy with specific cryptographic algorithms and key strengths, rather than the Azure default policy sets. It is thus recommended to use custom policy sets and choose strong cryptography.",
