  "description": "Root accounts with enabled access keys pose a significant security risk. Compromising a root account access key grants complete control over all AWS services and resources.\n\nAWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) manages user access to AWS services. Enabling access keys on a root account is a misconfiguration because root accounts inherently possess extensive privileges. A compromised access key allows attackers complete control, leading to data breaches, service disruptions, and financial losses.\n\nThe impact of this misconfiguration is catastrophic; attackers gain unrestricted access to all AWS resources, potentially leading to complete account takeover. Best practices dictate that root accounts should only be used for administrative tasks and should never have active access keys.\n\nMitigate this risk by immediately disabling access keys on the root account. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users, including the root account. Create and use IAM users with least privilege access for all day-to-day operations. Regularly rotate IAM access keys for all users.",
