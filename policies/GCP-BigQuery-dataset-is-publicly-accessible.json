  "description": "Publicly accessible GCP BigQuery datasets pose a significant data breach risk. Sensitive data within these datasets becomes vulnerable to unauthorized access and exfiltration by malicious actors or accidental exposure to unintended users.\n\nBigQuery's access control settings determine dataset visibility. Allowing 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' access grants broad read permissions, bypassing intended security controls. Attackers could exploit this misconfiguration to download sensitive data, leading to data breaches, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.\n\nThe impact of this misconfiguration includes unauthorized data access, potential data loss, and violations of data privacy regulations. Restricting access to only authorized users and groups is crucial for data protection and compliance. This ensures only legitimate users can access sensitive information.\n\nRemediation involves configuring granular access controls for each BigQuery dataset. Restrict access to specific users or groups using appropriate roles, avoiding 'allUsers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers'. Regularly audit dataset permissions to identify and remediate any unintended access grants.",
