  "name": "AWS Elastic Load Balancer v2 (ELBv2) SSL negotiation policy configured with weak ciphers",
  "description": "This policy identifies Elastic Load Balancers v2 (ELBv2) which are configured with SSL negotiation policy containing weak ciphers. An SSL cipher is an encryption algorithm that uses encryption keys to create a coded message. SSL protocols use several SSL ciphers to encrypt data over the Internet. As many of the other ciphers are not secure/weak, it is recommended to use only the ciphers recommended in the following AWS link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-https-listener.html",

  "recommendation": "1. Log in to the AWS console\n2. In the console, select the specific region from the region drop-down on the top right corner, for which the alert is generated\n3. Go to the EC2 Dashboard, and select 'Load Balancers'\n4. Click on the reported Load Balancer\n5. On the 'Listeners' tab, Choose the 'HTTPS' or 'SSL' rule; Click on 'Edit', Change 'Security policy' to other than 'ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-0-2015-04' as it contains DES-CBC3-SHA cipher, which is a weak cipher.\n6.
