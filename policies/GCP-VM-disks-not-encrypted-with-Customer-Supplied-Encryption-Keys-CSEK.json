  "description": "This policy identifies VM disks which are not encrypted with Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK). If you provide your own encryption keys, Compute Engine uses your key to protect the Google-generated keys used to encrypt and decrypt your data. It is recommended to use VM disks encrypted with CSEK for business-critical VM instances. \nLimitation: This policy might give false negatives in case VM disks are created with name prefix 'gke-'.",

  "searchModel.query": "config from cloud.resource where api.name = 'gcp-compute-disk-list' AND json.rule = status equals READY and name does not start with \"gke-\" and diskEncryptionKey.sha256 does not exist",
  "recommendation": "Currently, we can not update the encryption of an existing disk. So to fix this alert, Create a new VM disk with Encryption set to Customer supplied, migrate all required data from reported VM disk to newly created disk and delete the reported VM disk.\n\n1. Login to GCP Portal\n2. Go to Compute Engine\n3. Go to Disks\n4. Click on Create a disk\n5. Specify other disk parameters as you desire\n6. Set Encryption to Customer-supplied key\n7. Provide the Key in the box\n8. Select Wrapped key\n9. Click on Create",
