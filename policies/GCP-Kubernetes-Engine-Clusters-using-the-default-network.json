Because GKE uses this network when creating routes and firewalls for the cluster, as a best practice define a network configuration that meets your security and networking requirements for ingress and egress traffic, instead of using the default network.",

To resolve this alert, create a new cluster with a custom network that meets your requirements, then migrate the cluster data from the reported cluster to this newly created GKE cluster and delete the reported GKE cluster.\n\nTo create new Kubernetes engine cluster with the custom network, perform the following:\n1. Login to GCP Portal\n2. Go to Kubernetes Engine (Left Panel)\n3. Select Kubernetes clusters \n4. Click on CREATE CLUSTER button\n5. Set new cluster parameters as per your requirement and make sure 'Network' is set to other than 'default' under Networking section.\n6. Click on Save\n\nTo delete reported Kubernetes engine cluster, perform the following:\n1. Login to GCP Portal\n2. Go to Kubernetes Engine (Left Panel)\n3. Select Kubernetes clusters \n4. Click on reported Kubernetes cluster\n5. Click on the DELETE button\n6. On 'Delete a cluster' popup dialog, Click on DELETE to confirm the deletion of the cluster.",
