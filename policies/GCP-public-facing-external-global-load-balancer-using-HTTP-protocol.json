  "description": "This policy identifies GCP public-facing (external) global load balancers that are using HTTP protocol.\n\nUsing the HTTP protocol with a GCP external load balancer transmits data in plaintext, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping, interception, and modification by malicious actors. This lack of encryption exposes sensitive information, increases the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks, and compromises the overall security and privacy of the data exchanged between clients and servers.\n\nIt is recommended to use HTTPS protocol with external-facing load balancers.",
