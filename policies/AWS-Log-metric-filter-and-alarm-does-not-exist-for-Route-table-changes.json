  "description": "This policy identifies the AWS regions which do not have a log metric filter and alarm for Route table changes. Monitoring changes to route tables will help ensure that all VPC traffic flows through an expected path. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for changes to route tables.\n\nNOTE: This policy will trigger alert if you have at least one Cloudtrail with the multi trial is enabled, Logs all management events in your account and is not set with specific log metric filter and alarm.",
