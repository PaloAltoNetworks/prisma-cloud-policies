  "name": "AWS Access logging not enabled on S3 buckets",
  "description": "AWS S3 buckets without access logging enabled pose a significant security risk, leaving organizations vulnerable to data breaches and unauthorized access, hindering compliance efforts.\n\nAWS S3 access logging provides a detailed audit trail of all actions performed on your buckets. Disabling this feature prevents the detection of malicious activities like unauthorized data access or modification. Attackers could exploit this misconfiguration to exfiltrate sensitive data undetected.\n\nThe impact of this misconfiguration includes a lack of visibility into bucket activity, making incident response difficult and potentially leading to regulatory non-compliance and significant financial losses. Enabling access logging provides crucial evidence for security investigations and ensures accountability.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, ensure access logging is enabled on all S3 buckets. Regularly review bucket configurations to verify logging status and investigate any discrepancies. Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect when access logging is unexpectedly disabled.",
