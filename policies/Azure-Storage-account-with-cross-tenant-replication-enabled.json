  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Storage accounts that are enabled with cross tenant replication.\n\nAzure Storage account cross tenant replication allows data to be replicated across multiple Azure tenants. Though this feature is beneficial for data availability it also poses a significant security risk if not properly managed. Possible risks include unauthorized access to data, data leaks, and compliance violations. Disabling Cross Tenant Replication reduces the risk of unauthorized data access and prevents the accidental sharing of sensitive information.\n\nAs best practice, it is recommended to disable cross tenant replication on your storage accounts.",
