  "description": "This policy identifies GCP GKE Kubernetes services with network paths from untrusted internet sources on ports with high risk.\n\nGCP GKE Kubernetes services exposed to untrusted internet sources on high-risk ports increase the risk of unauthorized access, cyber-attacks, and data breaches, as they present a larger attack surface for malicious actors. These container services are particularly vulnerable to brute force attacks and exploits targeting known vulnerabilities.\n\nAs a best practice, it is recommended to allow access only from a Trusted IP list and to limit access to known hosts, services, or specific entities.\n\nNote: Prisma Cloud's Trusted IP List feature allows administrators to specify a list of IP addresses that are considered trusted or safe.",

  "recommendation": "The following steps are recommended to restrict GKE K8s service from having unrestricted access from the Internet:\n1. Visit the Network path Analysis from Source to Destination and review the network path components that allow internet access.\n2. Identify the network component on which restrictive rules can be implemented.\n3. Implement the necessary changes and ensure no other resources have been impacted due to these changes:\na) The overly permissive firewall rules can be made more restrictive.\nb) Move the container/application inside a restrictive subnet if public accessibility is not required.\nc) Remove or disassociate the public IP assigned to the respective container.",
