  "description": "This policy identifies GCP SQL instances that either lack SSL configuration or have SSL certificates that have expired.\n\nIf an SQL instance is not configured to use SSL, it may accept unencrypted and insecure connections, leading to potential risks such as data interception and authentication vulnerabilities.\n\nIt is a best practice to enable SSL configuration to ensure data security and integrity when communicating with a GCP SQL instance.",

  "recommendation": "To configure SQL instance with SSL configuration,follow the steps mentioned below:\n\n1. Log in to google cloud console\n2. Navigate to 'Cloud SQL Instances'\n3. Click on the alerted instance and navigate to 'Security' under 'Connections' tab\n4. Select one of the following under 'Manage SSL mode':\n\t i. Allow only SSL connections\n\t ii. Require trusted client certificates\n\nTo verify the validity of the current certificate, follow the steps mentioned below:\n\n1. Log in to google cloud console\n2. Navigate to 'Cloud SQL Instances'\n3. Click on the alerted instance and navigate to 'Security' under 'Connections' tab\n4. Verify the expiration date of your server certificate under 'Manage server CA certificates' table\n\nTo create a new client certificate, follow the URL mentioned: https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-ssl-instance#client-certs",
