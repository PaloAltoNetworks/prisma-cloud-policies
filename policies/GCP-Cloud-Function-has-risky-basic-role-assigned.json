  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Cloud Functions configured with the risky basic role. Basic roles are highly permissive roles that existed prior to the introduction of IAM and grant wide access over project to the grantee. To reduce the blast radius and defend against privilege escalations if the Cloud Function is compromised, it is recommended to follow the principle of least privilege and avoid use of basic roles.",
