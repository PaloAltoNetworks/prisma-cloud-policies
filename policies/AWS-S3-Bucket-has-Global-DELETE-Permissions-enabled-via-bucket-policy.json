  "description": "This policy identifies the S3 Bucket(s) which will allow any unauthenticated user to DELETE objects from a bucket. These permissions permit anyone, malicious or not, to DELETE objects from your S3 bucket if they can guess the namespace. Since the S3 service does not protect the namespace other than with ACLs and Bucket Policy, you risk loss or compromise of critical data by leaving this open.",
