  "description": "This policy identifies the AWS regions that do not have a log metric filter and alarm for AWS Organizations changes. Monitoring changes to AWS Organizations will help to ensure any unwanted, accidental, or intentional modifications that may lead to unauthorized access or other security breaches within the AWS account. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for detecting changes to AWS Organization's configurations.\n\nNOTE: This policy will trigger an alert if you have at least one Cloudtrail with the multi trial enabled, Logs all management events in your account, and is not set with a specific log metric filter and alarm.",
