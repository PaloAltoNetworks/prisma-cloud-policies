  "name": "Azure Storage Account without Secure transfer enabled",
  "description": "Azure Storage accounts without Secure Transfer enabled are vulnerable to data breaches. Disabling this feature allows access via insecure HTTP, exposing sensitive data during transit to interception and unauthorized modification.\n\nThe service setting \"Secure Transfer Required\" in Azure Storage Accounts enforces secure connections (HTTPS) for all data transfers. Disabling it exposes data to man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping, compromising data confidentiality and integrity. Attackers can intercept data transmitted over HTTP, leading to data theft or manipulation.\n\nThe impact of this misconfiguration is significant data exposure, potentially leading to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and reputational damage. Enforcing HTTPS protects data in transit, ensuring only authorized users can access storage accounts securely. This best practice minimizes the attack surface and strengthens the overall security posture.\n\nMitigate this risk by enabling \"Secure Transfer Required\" for all Azure Storage Accounts. Regularly audit storage account configurations to ensure compliance. Consider implementing network segmentation and intrusion detection systems for added protection.",
