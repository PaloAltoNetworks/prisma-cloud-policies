  "description": "This policy identifies Storage accounts which have Secure transfer feature disabled. The secure transfer option enhances the security of your storage account by only allowing requests to the storage account by a secure connection.\n\nWhen \"secure transfer required\" is disabled,REST APIs to access your storage accounts may connect over insecure HTTP which is not advised. Hence, it is highly recommended to enable secure transfer feature on your storage account.\n\nNOTE: Azure storage doesn't support HTTPs for custom domain names, this option is not applied when using a custom domain name. Additionally, this property is not applicable for NFS Azure file shares to work.",
