  "description": "This policy identifies the OCI compartments which do not have an Event Rule and Notification that gets triggered for security list changes. Monitoring and alerting on changes to Security Lists will help in identifying changes to traffic flowing into and out of Subnets within a Virtual Cloud Network. It is recommended that an Event Rule and Notification be configured to catch changes made to the security list.\nNOTE: \n1. Event Rules are compartment scoped and will detect events in child compartments, it is recommended to create the Event rule at the root compartment level.\n2. This policy will trigger alert if you have at least one Event Rule and Notification, even if OCI has single or multi compartments.",
