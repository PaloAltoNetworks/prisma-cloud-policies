  "name": "AWS ElastiCache cluster not associated with VPC",
  "description": "This policy identifies ElastiCache Clusters which are not associated with VPC. It is highly recommended to associate ElastiCache with VPC, as provides virtual network in your own logically isolated area and features such as selecting IP address range, creating subnets, and configuring route tables, network gateways, and security settings.\n\nNOTE: If you created your AWS account before 2013-12-04, you might have support for the EC2-Classic platform in some regions. AWS has deprecated the use of Amazon EC2-Classic for launching ElastiCache clusters. All current generation nodes are launched in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud only. So this policy only applies legacy ElastiCache clusters which are created using EC2-Classic.",

  "recommendation": "AWS ElastiCache cluster VPC association can be done only at the time of the creation of the cluster. So to fix this alert, create a new cluster with VPC, then migrate all required ElastiCache cluster data from the reported ElastiCache cluster to this newly created cluster and delete reported ElastiCache cluster.\n\nTo create new ElastiCache cluster with at-rest encryption set, perform the following:\n1. Sign into the AWS console\n2. In the console, select the specific region from region drop down on the top right corner, for which the alert is generated\n3. Navigate to ElastiCache Dashboard\n4. Click on Redis or Memcached based on your requirement\n5. Choose cluster parameters as per your requirement\n6. Click on 'Advanced Redis settings' to expand the cluster advanced settings panel\n7. Select desired VPC for 'Subnet group' along with other parameters\nNOTE: If you don't specify a subnet when you launch a cluster, the cluster launches into your default Amazon VPC.\n8. Click on 'Create' button to launch your new ElastiCache cluster\n\nTo delete reported ElastiCache cluster, perform the following:\n1. Sign into the AWS console\n2. In the console, select the specific region from region drop down on the top right corner, for which the alert is generated\n3. Navigate to ElastiCache Dashboard\n4. Select reported cluster\n5. Click on 'Delete' button\n6. In the 'Delete Cluster' dialog box, if you want a backup for your cluster select 'Yes' from the 'Create final backup' dropdown menu, provide a name for the cluster backup, then click on 'Delete'.",
