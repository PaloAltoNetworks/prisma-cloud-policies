  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Key vaults used for machine learning workspace secrets storage that are not enabled with audit logging.\n\nAzure Key vaults are used to store machine learning workspace secrets and other sensitive information that is needed by the workspace. Enabling key vaults with audit logging will help in monitoring how and when machine learning workspace secrets are accessed, and by whom. This audit log data enhances visibility by providing valuable insights into the trail of interactions involving confidential information.\n\nAs a best practice,  it is recommended to enable audit event logging for key vaults used for machine learning workspace secrets storage.",
