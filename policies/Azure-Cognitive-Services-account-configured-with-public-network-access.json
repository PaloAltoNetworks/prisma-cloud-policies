  "description": "Public network access enabled on Azure Cognitive Services accounts presents a significant security risk. Malicious actors could potentially access and exploit these services via untrusted IPs.\n\nAzure Cognitive Services accounts, by default, can be configured to allow access from any IP address. This misconfiguration exposes sensitive data and functionalities to the public internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruptions. Attackers can exploit this to perform data exfiltration, denial-of-service attacks, or even gain unauthorized access to other connected systems.\n\nThe impact of this misconfiguration could be severe, ranging from data loss and financial damage to reputational harm and regulatory non-compliance. Restricting network access to trusted IP addresses only significantly reduces the attack surface and mitigates these risks, ensuring only authorized entities can interact with the service.\n\nTo remediate, configure your Azure Cognitive Services account to allow access only from specific, explicitly trusted IP addresses or IP ranges. Regularly review and update these allowed IP addresses to maintain a strong security posture and limit exposure to potential threats. Utilize network segmentation and other security controls to further isolate the Cognitive Services account from the broader network.",
