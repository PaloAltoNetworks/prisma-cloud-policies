  "description": "This policy identifies Kubernetes Engine clusters that have enabled Client Certificate authentication. A client certificate is a base64-encoded public certificate used by clients to authenticate to the cluster endpoint. GKE manages authentication via gcloud using the OpenID Connect token method, setting up the Kubernetes configuration, getting an access token, and keeping it up to date. So it is recommended not to enable Client Certificate authentication, to avoid additional management overhead of key management and rotation.\n\nNote: For GKE Autopilot clusters, legacy authentication methods cannot be used. Basic authentication is deprecated and has been removed in GKE 1.19 and later.\n\nReference: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/api-server-authentication#legacy-auth",

  "recommendation": "GCP Kubernetes Clusters Client Certificate can be disabled only at the time of the creation of clusters. So to fix this alert, create a new cluster with Client Certificate disabled and then migrate all required cluster data or containers from the reported cluster to this new cluster.\n\nTo create the cluster with Client Certificate disabled, perform the following steps:\n1. Login to GCP Portal\n2. Go to Kubernetes Engine (Left Panel)\n3. Click on 'Clusters' (Left Panel)\n4. On page 'Kubernetes clusters', click on 'CREATE'\n5. Select the type of cluster by clicking on the 'CONFIGURE' button\n6. Select ‘Security’ tab (Left Panel)\n7. Under the 'Legacy security options' section, ensure 'Issue a client certificate' is not set\n8. Provide all required cluster data or containers from the reported cluster to this new cluster\n9. Click on 'CREATE' to create a new cluster\n10. Once the cluster is created, delete the alerted cluster to resolve the alert",
