  "description": "This policy identifies Azure log profiles that are not capturing activity logs for all regions. Activity logs are exported from all the Azure supported regions/locations means that logs for potentially unexpected activities occurring in otherwise unused regions are stored and made available for incident response and investigations.\n\nNote: Since this type of logging is not deprecated from the Cloud service provider yet, we support it until it is removed.",

In case there is a difference in the count of regions from step 1 and step 2, Execute the command to list all regions az account list-locations --query '[*].name'\n4.
