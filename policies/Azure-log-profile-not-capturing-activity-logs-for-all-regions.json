Activity logs are exported from all the Azure supported regions/locations means that logs for potentially unexpected activities occurring in otherwise unused regions are stored and made available for incident response and investigations.\n\nNote: Since this type of logging is not deprecated from the Cloud service provider yet, we support it until it is removed.",
