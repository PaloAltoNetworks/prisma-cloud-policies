  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Storage Account which is using insecure TLS version. Azure Storage Account uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) from communication with client applications. As a best security practice, use newer TLS version as the minimum TLS version for Azure Storage Account. Currently, Azure Storage Account supports TLS 1.2 version which resolves the security gap from its preceding versions.\n\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/transport-layer-security-configure-minimum-version?tabs=portal",
