It is recommended that to avoid data leakage provide your own encryption keys, Compute Engine uses your key to protect the Google-generated keys used to encrypt and decrypt your data. Only users who can provide the correct key can use resources protected by a customer-supplied encryption key.\n\n",

To resolve the alert a new instance can be created from the snapshot and disks can be encrypted as per the requirement. Then delete the alerted snapshot.\n\nTo create an Instance,\n1.
