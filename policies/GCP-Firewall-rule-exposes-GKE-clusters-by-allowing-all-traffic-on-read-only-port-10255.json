  "name": "GCP Firewall rule exposes GKE clusters by allowing all traffic on read-only port (10255)",
  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Firewall rule allowing all traffic on read-only port (10255) which exposes GKE clusters. In GKE, Kubelet exposes a read-only port 10255 which shows the configurations of all pods on the cluster at the /pods API endpoint. GKE itself does not expose this port to the Internet as the default project firewall configuration blocks external access. However, it is possible to inadvertently expose this port publicly on GKE clusters by creating a Google Compute Engine VPC firewall for GKE nodes that allows traffic from all source ranges on all the ports. This configuration publicly exposes all pod configurations, which might contain sensitive information.",
