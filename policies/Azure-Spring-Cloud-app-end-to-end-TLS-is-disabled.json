  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Spring Cloud apps in which end-to-end TLS is disabled. Enabling end-to-end TLS/SSL will secure traffic from ingress controller to apps. After you enable end-to-end TLS and load a cert from the key vault, all communications within Azure Spring Cloud are secured with TLS. As a security best practice, it is recommended to have an end-to-end TLS to secure Spring Cloud apps traffic.",
