  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Virtual Machines that are hosted with SQL on them and have basic authentication. \n\nAzure Virtual Machines with basic authentication could allow attackers to brute force and gain access to SQL database hosted on it, which might lead to information leakage. It is recommended to use SSH keys for authentication to avoid brute force attacks on SQL database hosted virtual machines.",
