  "name": "Azure Storage account encryption key configured by access policy with privileged operations",
  "description": "Azure Storage accounts with encryption keys configured via access policies granting privileged operations present a significant security risk. Improperly configured access policies allow unauthorized entities to manipulate or delete encrypted data.\n\nAzure Storage account encryption keys are managed through access policies. Granting privileged write or delete access to these policies enables malicious actors to modify or remove encrypted data, bypassing intended security controls. An attacker exploiting this misconfiguration could exfiltrate sensitive data or disrupt operations.\n\nThe impact of this misconfiguration includes data breaches, data loss, and service disruption. Restricting access to encryption keys ensures only authorized entities with necessary permissions can interact with them, minimizing the risk of unauthorized data manipulation or deletion. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, implement the principle of least privilege. Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to access policies associated with storage account encryption keys. Regularly review and audit access policies to identify and remove unnecessary privileges. Employ strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect access to these policies.",
