  "name": "Azure Storage account encryption key configured by access policy with privileged operations",
  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Storage accounts which are encrypted by an encryption key configured access policy with privileged operations. Encryption keys should be kept confidential and only accessible to authorized entity with limited operation access. Allowing privileged access to an encryption key also allows to alter/delete the data that is encrypted by it, making the data more easily accessible. It is recommended to have restricted access policies to an encryption key so that only authorized entities can access it with limited operation access. ",
