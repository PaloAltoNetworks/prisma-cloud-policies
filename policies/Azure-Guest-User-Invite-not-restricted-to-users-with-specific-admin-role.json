  "description": "This policy identifies instances in the Microsoft Entra ID configuration where guest user invitations are not restricted to specific administrative roles.\n\nAllowing anyone in the organization, including guests and non-admins, to invite guest users can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. This unrestricted access poses a significant security risk.\n\nAs a best practice, it is recommended to configure guest user invites to specific admin roles. This will ensure that only authorized personnel can invite guests, maintaining tighter control over access to cloud resources.",
