  "name": "GCP User managed service accounts have user managed service account keys",
  "description": "This policy identifies user managed service accounts that use user managed service account keys instead of Google-managed. For user-managed keys, the User has to take ownership of key management activities. Even after owner precaution, keys can be easily leaked by common development malpractices like checking keys into the source code or leaving them in downloads directory or accidentally leaving them on support blogs/channels. So It is recommended to limit the use of User-managed service account keys and instead use Google-managed keys which can not be downloaded.",

  "recommendation": "If the use of user managed keys is a requirement, limit the use by applying the constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation Organization Policy Constraint to projects, folders, or the entire organization. Enable user-managed keys in well-controlled locations after applying the constraint.\n\nDelete the user managed keys that are not protected or not in use. Deleting user managed service account keys can affect the applications that use the key.\n\nTo delete user managed service account keys:\n1. Login to GCP Portal\n2. Go to APIs & Services (Left Panel)\n3. Select Credentials\n4. In the Service Account Keys section, for every reported user managed service account key, review and click Delete bin icon to delete service account keys.",
