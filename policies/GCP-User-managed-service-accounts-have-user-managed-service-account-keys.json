  "name": "GCP User managed service accounts have user managed service account keys",
  "description": "This policy identifies user managed service accounts that use user managed service account keys instead of Google-managed. For user-managed keys, the User has to take ownership of key management activities. Even after owner precaution, keys can be easily leaked by common development malpractices like checking keys into the source code or leaving them in downloads directory or accidentally leaving them on support blogs/channels. So It is recommended to limit the use of User-managed service account keys and instead use Google-managed keys which cannot be downloaded.\n\nNote: This policy might alert the service accounts which are not created using Terraform for cloud account onboarding. These alerts are valid as no user-managed service account should be used for cloud account onboarding.",
