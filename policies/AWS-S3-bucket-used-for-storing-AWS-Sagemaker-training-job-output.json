  "description": "Improperly configured AWS S3 buckets storing Sagemaker training job output expose sensitive model data to unauthorized access.\n\nSagemaker utilizes S3 buckets to store training outputs, including model artifacts and results. Inadequate access controls could allow unauthorized entities to download, modify, or delete this sensitive data. Untrusted IP addresses accessing these buckets directly increase the risk of data breaches and intellectual property theft.\n\nCompromised training outputs could lead to model manipulation, resulting in inaccurate predictions or malicious use of the trained model. This exposes the organization to significant financial losses and reputational damage. Maintaining strict access control minimizes this risk.\n\nImplement least privilege access; only grant necessary permissions to authorized users and services. Enable encryption at rest and in transit for all data stored in the S3 bucket. Regularly audit access logs and implement robust monitoring for suspicious activity originating from untrusted IP addresses.",
