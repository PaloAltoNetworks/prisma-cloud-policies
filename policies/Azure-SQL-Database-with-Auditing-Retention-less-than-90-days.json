  "description": "This policy identifies SQL Databases that have Auditing Retention less than 90 days. Audit Logs can be used to check for anomalies and gives insight into suspected breaches or misuse of information and access. If server auditing is enabled, it always applies to the database. The database will be audited, regardless of the database auditing settings. It is recommended to configure SQL database Audit Retention to be greater than or equal to 90 days and leave the database-level auditing disabled for all databases.",

Log in to the Azure Portal\n2. Go to SQL servers\n3. Choose the reported each DB server\n4. Select 'Auditing', and verify that 'Enable Azure SQL Auditing' is set\n5. If Storage is selected, expand 'Advanced properties'\n6. Set the Retention (days) setting is greater than 90 days or 0 for unlimited retention.\nNote: The default value for the retention period is 0 (unlimited retention).\n7.
