  "name": "Azure Storage account Encryption Customer Managed Keys Disabled",
  "description": "Azure Storage accounts lacking Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) for encryption present a significant security risk. Disabling CMKs means Microsoft manages encryption keys, reducing organizational control over sensitive data stored within the account.\n\nAzure Storage accounts utilize encryption at rest, either via Microsoft-managed keys or customer-managed keys. Without CMKs, the organization loses direct control over key management, increasing the risk of data breaches if Microsoft's key management systems are compromised. Attackers gaining access to the storage account could directly access unencrypted data.\n\nData breaches resulting from this misconfiguration could expose sensitive information, leading to regulatory fines, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust. Using CMKs ensures that only authorized personnel within the organization can manage encryption keys, providing stronger control and mitigating the risks associated with key compromise.\n\nTo remediate this, enable CMKs for all Azure Storage accounts. Integrate key management into existing security processes, regularly rotate keys, and utilize robust access control mechanisms to limit who can manage these keys. This ensures stronger control over data encryption and reduces the risk of data breaches.",
