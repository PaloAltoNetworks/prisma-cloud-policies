  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Logic apps that are not configured with managed identity.\n\nManaged identity can be used to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication, without having credentials in your code. Including credentials in code heightens the risk in the event of a security breach and increases the threat surface in case of exploitation and also managed identities eliminate the need for developers to manage credentials.\n\nAs a security best practice, it is recommended to set up managed identity rather than embedding credentials within the code.",
