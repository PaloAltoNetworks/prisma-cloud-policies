  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud where the Agentless scanning for machines is set to Off.\n\nAgentless scanning uses disk snapshots to detect installed software, vulnerabilities, and plain text secrets without needing agents on each machine. When disabled, your environment risks exposure to software vulnerabilities and unauthorized software, diminishing visibility into security issues. Enabling Agentless scanning improves security by identifying vulnerabilities and sensitive data with minimal performance impact, streamlining management and ensuring strong threat detection and compliance.\n\nAs a security best practice, it is recommended to enable Agentless scanning for machines in Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud.",
