  "description": "This policy identifies VPCs which are nearing availability limit of subnets. AWS provides a reasonable starting limitation for the maximum number of VPC subnets you can assign in each VPC. If you approach the limit in a particular VPC, you have nearly exhausted your allocation. As a best practice, it is recommended to remove Subnets that are not associated or not used, it will also help you avoid unexpected charges on your bill.\nNOTE: As per https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html. On the date, Subnets per VPC limit is 200. This policy will trigger an alert if Subnets per VPC reached 80% (i.e. 160) of resource availability limit allocated. If you need more Subnets in a VPC, You can contact AWS for a service limit increase.",
