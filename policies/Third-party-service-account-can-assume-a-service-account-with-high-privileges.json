Examine the role's trust relationship and permissions as well as its use case - if needed reach out to the vendor to validate which permissions are necessary for their functions and why\nIn order to remove any unnecessary permissions and minimize trusted entities which can assume the role, use the following remediation steps:\nTo revoke the vendor's access to assume the role altogether, browse to the role in the AWS Console and select \"Trust relationships\"->\"Edit trust policy\". Modify the role's trust relationship as per requirements. To minimize the access the vendor has using the role, under the \"Permissions\" tab, select the relevant policy and remove unnecessary permissions by either editing the policy or replacing it (notice: editing a managed policy could affect other roles).",
