  "description": "This policy identifies the OCI compartments which do not have an Event Rule and Notification that gets triggered for Network Security Group (NSG) changes. Monitoring and alerting on changes to security groups will help in identifying changes to traffic flowing between Virtual Network Cards attached to Compute instances. It is recommended that an Event Rule and Notification be configured to catch changes made to Network Security Groups.\nNOTE: \n1. Event Rules are compartment scoped and will detect events in child compartments, it is recommended to create the Event rule at the root compartment level.\n2. This policy will trigger alert if you have at least one Event Rule and Notification, even if OCI has single or multi compartments.",
