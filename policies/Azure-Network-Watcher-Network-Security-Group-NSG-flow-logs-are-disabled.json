  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Network Security Groups (NSG) for which flow logs are disabled. To perform this check, enable this action on the Azure Service Principal: 'Microsoft.Network/networkWatchers/queryFlowLogStatus/action'.\n\nNSG flow logs, a feature of the Network Watcher app, enable you to view information about ingress and egress IP traffic through an NSG. The flow logs include information such as:\n- Outbound and inbound flows on a per-rule basis.\n- Network interface to which the flow applies.\n- 5-tuple information about the flow (source/destination IP, source/destination port, protocol).\n- Whether the traffic was allowed or denied.\n\nAs a best practice, enable NSG flow logs to improve network visibility.",
