  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Active Directory Guest users. Azure Active Directory allows B2B collaboration which lets you invite people from outside your organisation to be guest users in your cloud account. Avoid creating guest user in your cloud account unless you have business need. Guest users are usually added for users outside your employee on-boarding/off-boarding process and could potentially be overlooked leading to a potential vulnerability.",
