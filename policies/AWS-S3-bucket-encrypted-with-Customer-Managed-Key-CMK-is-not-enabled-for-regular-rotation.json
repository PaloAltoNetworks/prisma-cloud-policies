  "description": "This policy identifies Amazon S3 buckets that use Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) for encryption but are not enabled with key rotation. Amazon S3 bucket encryption key rotation failure can result in prolonged exposure of sensitive data and potential compliance violations. As a security best practice, it is important to rotate these keys periodically. This ensures that if the keys are compromised, the data in the underlying service remains secure with the new keys.",
