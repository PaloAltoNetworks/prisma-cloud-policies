  "name": "AWS S3 bucket encrypted with Customer Managed Key (CMK) is not enabled for regular rotation",
  "description": "AWS S3 buckets encrypted with Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) lacking regular rotation pose a significant security risk. Failure to rotate these keys extends the potential window of exposure for sensitive data should a compromise occur.\n\nAWS S3 utilizes CMKs to encrypt data at rest. However, if a CMK is compromised, an attacker could decrypt data stored within the bucket for an extended period if key rotation is not enabled. This lack of rotation increases the risk of data breaches and compliance violations.\n\nThe impact of this misconfiguration includes prolonged exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to data breaches, financial losses, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties. Regular CMK rotation mitigates this risk by limiting the impact of any compromise to a shorter timeframe.\n\nImplement a regular schedule for CMK rotation. Establish a process to automate key rotation and monitor for successful completion. Use strong key management practices, and regularly audit the CMK rotation configuration to ensure its effectiveness.",

Log in to the AWS Console and navigate to the 'S3' service.\n2. Click on the S3 bucket reported in the alert.\n3. Click on the 'Properties' tab.\n4. Under the 'Default encryption' section, click on the KMS key link in 'Encryption key ARN'.\n5. Under the 'Key rotation' tab on the navigated KMS key window, Enable 'Automatically rotate this CMK every year'.\n6. Click on Save.",
