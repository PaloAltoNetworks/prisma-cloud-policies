  "description": "This policy identifies the CodeBuild projects where the privileged mode is enabled. Privileged mode grants unrestricted access to all devices and runs the Docker daemon inside the container. It is recommended to enable this mode only for building Docker images. It recommended disabling the privileged mode to prevent unintended access to Docker APIs and container hardware, reducing the risk of potential tampering or critical resource deletion.",
