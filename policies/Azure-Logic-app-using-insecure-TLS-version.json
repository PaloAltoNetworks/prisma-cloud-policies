  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Logic apps that are using insecure TLS version.\n\nAzure Logic apps configured to use insecure TLS versions are at risk as they may be vulnerable to security threats due to the known vulnerabilities, weaker encryption methods, and support for compromised hash functions. Logic apps using TLS 1.2 or higher will secure communication and protect against potential cyber attacks.\n\nAs a security best practice,  it is recommended to configure Logic apps with TLS 1.2 or higher to ensure secure communication.",
