  "description": "This policy identifies AWS Default VPCs that are being used.\n\nAWS creates a default VPC automatically upon the creation of your AWS account with a default security group and network access control list (NACL). Using AWS default VPC can lead to limited customization and security concerns due to shared resources and potential misconfigurations, hindering scalability and optimal resource management.\n\nAs a best practice, using a custom VPC with specific security and network configuration provides greater flexibility and control over your architecture.",
