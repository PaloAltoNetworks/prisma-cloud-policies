  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Cloud Functions that are publicly accessible by allUsers or allAuthenticatedUsers. This includes both Cloud Functions v1 and Cloud Functions v2.\n\nGranting permissions to 'allusers' or 'allAuthenticatedUsers' on any resource in GCP makes the resource public. Public access over cloud functions can lead to unauthorized invocations of the function or leakage of sensitive information such as the function's source code. \n\nFollowing the least privileged access policy, it is recommended to grant access restrictively and avoid granting permissions to allUsers or allAuthenticatedUsers unless absolutely needed.",
