  "description": "This policy identifies OCI Load balancers that are not configured with a Web application firewall (WAF).\n\nA Web Application Firewall (WAF) helps protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet. Without WAF, load balancers are vulnerable to various web-based attacks, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common exploits. This can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents.\n\nAs a best practice, it is recommended to configure Web Application Firewall (WAF) for OCI Load Balancers to enhance security.",
