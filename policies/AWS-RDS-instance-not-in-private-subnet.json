Open the Amazon RDS console.\n2. In the navigation pane, choose Subnet groups.\n3. Choose Create DB Subnet Group.\n4. Type the name of your DB subnet group.\n5. Add a description for your DB subnet group.\n6. Choose your VPC.\n7. In the Add subnets section, add your Private subnets related to this VPC.\n8. Choose Create.\n\nWhen creating your RDS DB, under Configure advanced settings, choose the Subnet group created above.",
