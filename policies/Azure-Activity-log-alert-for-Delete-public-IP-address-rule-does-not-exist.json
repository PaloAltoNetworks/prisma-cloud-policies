  "description": "This policy identifies the Azure accounts in which activity log alert for Delete public IP address rule does not exist.\n\nCreating an activity log alert for Delete public IP address rule gives insight into network rule access changes and may reduce the time it takes to detect suspicious activity. By enabling this monitoring, you get alerts whenever any deletions are made to public IP addresses rules.\n\nAs a best practice, it is recommended to have an activity log alert for Delete public IP address rule to enhance network security monitoring and detect suspicious activities.",
