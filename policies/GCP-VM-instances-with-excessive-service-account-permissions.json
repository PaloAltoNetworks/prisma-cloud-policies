  "name": "GCP VM instances with excessive service account permissions",
  "description": "This policy identifies VM instances with service account which have excessive permissions other than viewer/reader access. It is recommended that each instance that needs to call a Google API should run as a service account with the minimum permissions necessary for that instance to do its job. In practice, this means you should configure service accounts for your instances with the following process:\n\t- Create a new service account rather than using the Compute Engine default service account.\n\t- Grant IAM roles to that service account for only the resources that it needs.\n\t- Configure the instance to run as that service account.\n\t- Configure VM instance least permissive service account with only viewer/reader role until it is necessary to have more access.\nAvoid granting more access than necessary and regularly check your service account permissions to make sure they are up-to-date.",

  "recommendation": "Note: To change an instance's service account and access scopes, the instance must be temporarily stopped. To stop your instance, read the documentation for Stopping an instance. After changing the service account or access scopes, remember to restart the instance.\n\nTo change service account of the stopped instance:\n1. Login to GCP portal \n2. Go to Compute Engine\n3. Choose VM instances\n4. Click on the reported VM instance for which you want to change the service account\n5. If the instance is not stopped, click the Stop button. Wait for the instance to be stopped\n6. Next, click the Edit button\n7. Scroll down to the Service Account section, From the drop-down menu, select the desired service account\nNote: To fix this alert either you have to associate service account which has only viewer access or if VM has desired service account and access then dismiss the alert for particular VM instance.\n8.
