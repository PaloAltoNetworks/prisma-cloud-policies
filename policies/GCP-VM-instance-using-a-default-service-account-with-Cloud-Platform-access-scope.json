  "description": "GCP VM instances employing the default service account with 'cloud-platform' access scope present a significant security risk. These instances possess excessive privileges, increasing the potential for unauthorized access and data breaches.\n\nThe default service account, 'Compute Engine default service account', coupled with the 'cloud-platform' scope, grants VMs extensive access to GCP resources. This broad access enables attackers who compromise a VM to potentially escalate privileges and access sensitive data or other resources. Failure to restrict access elevates the impact of a successful compromise.\n\nA misconfiguration allowing broad access significantly increases the blast radius of a successful attack. An attacker gaining control of a compromised VM with 'cloud-platform' scope could access and manipulate any GCP resource, leading to data exfiltration, service disruption, or complete account takeover. Restricting access aligns with the principle of least privilege, minimizing the potential damage from a security incident.\n\nRemediate this risk by assigning VMs custom service accounts with only the necessary permissions. Define a clear set of required permissions for each service account and regularly review and update these permissions. Use the IAM (Identity and Access Management) functionality to manage access carefully. Employ least privilege, only granting necessary roles to specific service accounts assigned to Virtual Machines.",
