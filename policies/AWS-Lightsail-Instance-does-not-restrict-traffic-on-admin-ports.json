  "description": "This policy identifies the AWS Lightsail instance having network rule with unrestricted access (\"0.0.0.0/0\" or \"::/0\") on port 22 or 3389.\n\nThe firewall in Amazon Lightsail manages inbound traffic permitted to connect to your instance via its public IP address, controlling access to specific IPs and ports. Leaving administrative ports open to unrestricted access increases the risk of unauthorized access, such as brute-force attacks, which can compromise the instance and expose sensitive data.\n\nIt is recommended to limit access to specific IP addresses in the firewall rules to reduce unauthorized access attempts.",
