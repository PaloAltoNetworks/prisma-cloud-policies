  "description": "This policy identifies AWS DMS replication task where logging is either not enabled or set below the minimum severity level, such as LOGGER_SEVERITY_DEFAULT, for SOURCE_CAPTURE and SOURCE_UNLOAD.\n\nLogging is indispensable in DMS replication for various purposes, including monitoring, troubleshooting, auditing, performance analysis, error detection, recovery, and historical reporting. SOURCE_CAPTURE captures ongoing replication or CDC data from the source database, while SOURCE_UNLOAD unloads data during full load. Logging these tasks is crucial for ensuring data integrity, compliance, and accountability during migration.\n\nIt is recommended to enable logging for AWS DMS replication tasks and set a minimal logging level of DEFAULT for SOURCE_CAPTURE and SOURCE_UNLOAD to ensure that essential messages are logged, facilitating effective monitoring, troubleshooting, and compliance efforts.",
