  "description": "This policy identifies an AWS IAM user as not being a member of any IAM group.\n\nIt is generally a best practice to assign IAM users to at least one IAM group. If the IAM users are not in a group, it complicates permission management and auditing, increasing the risk of privilege mismanagement and security oversights. It also leads to higher operational overhead and potential non-compliance with security best practices.\n\nIt is recommended to ensure all IAM users are part of at least one IAM group according to your business requirement to simplify permission management, enforce consistent security policies, and reduce the risk of privilege mismanagement.",
