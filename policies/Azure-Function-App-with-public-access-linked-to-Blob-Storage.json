  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Function Apps configured with public access and linked to Azure Blob Storage.\n\nAzure Function Apps often access Blob Storage to retrieve or store data. When public access is enabled for the Function App, it exposes the application and, potentially, the associated Blob Storage to unauthorized access, leading to potential security risks.\n\nAs a security best practice, it is recommended to evaluate public access for Azure Function Apps and secure Azure Blob Storage.",
