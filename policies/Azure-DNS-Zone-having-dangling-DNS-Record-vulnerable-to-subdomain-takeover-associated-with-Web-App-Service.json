  "name": "Azure DNS Zone having dangling DNS Record vulnerable to subdomain takeover associated with Web App Service",
  "description": "Dangling DNS records in Azure DNS zones associated with deleted Azure Web App Services pose a significant subdomain takeover risk. These records point to non-existent resources, leaving subdomains vulnerable to malicious registration by attackers.\n\nAzure DNS zones manage domain name resolution for Azure resources, including Web App Services. Improper management of DNS records, specifically failing to remove records for deleted Web App Services, creates a misconfiguration. Attackers can exploit this by registering a new Web App Service with the same name, redirecting traffic to malicious content and potentially compromising user credentials or data.\n\nThe impact of this misconfiguration includes phishing attacks, data breaches, brand damage, and disruption of services. Maintaining accurate DNS records ensures proper domain name resolution and prevents unauthorized resource registration. Deleting dangling DNS records eliminates the possibility of subdomain takeover.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, regularly audit Azure DNS zones for records pointing to non-existent Web App Services. Promptly delete or update any dangling records. Implement automated processes to detect and remediate these misconfigurations. Regularly review and update your DNS records to reflect the current state of your Azure resources.",
