  "description": "This policy identifies DNS records within an Azure DNS zone that point to Azure Web App Services that no longer exist.\n\nA dangling DNS attack happens when a DNS record points to a cloud resource that has been deleted or is inactive, making the subdomain vulnerable to takeover. An attacker can exploit this by creating a new resource with the same name and taking control of the subdomain to serve malicious content. This allows attackers to host harmful content under your subdomain, which could lead to phishing attacks, data breaches, and damage to your reputation. The risk arises because the DNS record still references a non-existent resource, which unauthorized individuals can re-associate with their own resources.\n\nAs a security best practice, it is recommended to routinely audit DNS zones and remove or update DNS records pointing to non-existing Web App Services.",
