  "description": "This policy identifies AWS IAM groups that are not actively in use. \n\nAn AWS IAM group is a collection of IAM users managed together, allowing for unified permission assignment. These groups, if not assigned any users, pose a potential security risk if left unmanaged and can inadvertently grant unauthorized access to AWS services and resources. \n\nIt is recommended to review and remove any unused IAM groups to prevent attaching unauthorized IAM users.",
