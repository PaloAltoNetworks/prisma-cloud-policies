  "name": "GCP Log metric filter and alert does not exist for VPC Network Firewall rule changes",
  "description": "This policy identifies GCP projects that do not have log metric filters and alerts for VPC Network Firewall rule modifications.\n\nVPC Network Firewall rules govern network traffic flow, and unauthorized changes can severely impact security and availability. Without real-time monitoring and alerting on rule modifications (additions, deletions, or updates), organizations are vulnerable to undetected attacks, misconfigurations, and performance issues. Proactive alerts enable swift responses to suspicious activity, preventing breaches and ensuring business continuity. Implementing this monitoring provides crucial visibility and control over network security posture.\n\nIt is recommended to configure log metric filters and alerts within your GCP projects to monitor all VPC Network Firewall rule changes. This will enable prompt detection of unauthorized modifications, facilitating rapid remediation and maintaining the integrity and security of your network infrastructure.",
